8,8,seven i answered
9,9,indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
10,10,then how do you know
11,11,i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
12,12,frequently
13,13,how often
14,14,well some hundreds of times
15,15,then how many are there
16,16,how many i dont know
17,17,"this is indeed a mystery i remarked ""what do you imagine that it means"""
18,18,i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it
19,19,"peculiarthat is the very word said holmes ""it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light"""
20,20,what do you make of that asked holmes
21,21,the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather
22,22,the paper was made in bohemia i said
23,23,precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts
24,24,i think that i had better go holmes
25,25,not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it
26,26,but your client
27,27,never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention
28,28,come in said holmes
29,29,you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone
30,30,i promise said holmes
31,31,and i
32,32,i was aware of it said holmes dryly
33,33,the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia
34,34,the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you
35,35,precisely so but how
36,36,was there a secret marriage
37,37,none
38,38,no legal papers or certificates
39,39,none
40,40,then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity
41,41,there is the writing
42,42,pooh pooh forgery
43,43,my private notepaper
44,44,stolen
45,45,my own seal
46,46,imitated
47,47,my photograph
48,48,bought
49,49,we were both in the photograph
50,50,oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
51,51,i was madinsane
52,52,you have compromised yourself seriously
53,53,i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now
54,54,it must be recovered
55,55,we have tried and failed
56,56,your majesty must pay it must be bought
57,57,she will not sell
58,58,stolen then
59,59,five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result
60,60,no sign of it
61,61,absolutely none
62,62,to ruin me
63,63,but how
64,64,i am about to be married
65,65,so i have heard
66,66,to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
67,67,and irene adler
68,68,threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone
69,69,you are sure that she has not sent it yet
70,70,i am sure
71,71,and why
72,72,because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday
73,73,certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm
74,74,then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
75,75,pray do so i shall be all anxiety
76,76,then as to money
77,77,you have carte blanche
78,78,absolutely
79,79,i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
80,80,and for present expenses
81,81,the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table
82,82,there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said
83,83,holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him
84,84,and mademoiselles address he asked
85,85,is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood
86,86,it was
87,87,ii
88,88,what is it
89,89,its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing
90,90,i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler
91,91,and what of irene adler i asked
92,92,i am following you closely i answered
93,93," thank god he cried youll do come come

 what then i asked"
94,94,"this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i ""and what then"""
95,95,well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements
96,96,which are
97,97,i shall be delighted
98,98,you dont mind breaking the law
99,99,not in the least
100,100,nor running a chance of arrest
101,101,not in a good cause
102,102,oh the cause is excellent
103,103,then i am your man
104,104,i was sure that i might rely on you
105,105,but what is it you wish
106,106,and what then
107,107,you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand
108,108,i am to be neutral
109,109,to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window
110,110,yes
111,111,you are to watch me for i will be visible to you
112,112,yes
113,113,and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me
114,114,entirely
115,115,i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street
116,116,precisely
117,117,then you may entirely rely on me
118,118,that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play
119,119,where indeed
120,120,it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
121,121,where then
122,122,her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house
123,123,but it has twice been burgled
124,124,pshaw they did not know how to look
125,125,but how will you look
126,126,i will not look
127,127,what then
128,128,i will get her to show me
129,129,but she will refuse
130,130,she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter
131,131,is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked
132,132,he is dead cried several voices
133,133,"no no theres life in him shouted another ""but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital"""
134,134,he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm
135,135,surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please
136,136,"you did it very nicely doctor he remarked ""nothing could have been better it is all right"""
137,137,you have the photograph
138,138,i know where it is
139,139,and how did you find out
140,140,she showed me as i told you she would
141,141,i am still in the dark
142,142,i guessed as much
143,143,then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick
144,144,that also i could fathom
145,145,then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
146,146,how did that help you
147,147,it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all
148,148,and now i asked
149,149,our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands
150,150,and when will you call
151,151,at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay
152,152,we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said
153,153,goodnight mister sherlock holmes
154,154,iii
155,155,not yet
156,156,but you have hopes
157,157,i have hopes
158,158,then come i am all impatience to be gone
159,159,we must have a cab
160,160,no my brougham is waiting
161,161,then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge
162,162,irene adler is married remarked holmes
163,163,married when
164,164,yesterday
165,165,but to whom
166,166,to an english lawyer named norton
167,167,but she could not love him
168,168,i am in hopes that she does
169,169,and why in hopes
170,170,because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan
171,171,mr sherlock holmes i believe said she
172,172,indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the  train from charing cross for the continent
173,173,never to return
174,174,"and the papers asked the king hoarsely ""all is lost"""
175,175,irene norton nee adler
176,176,"from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly ""i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion"""
177,177,"on the contrary my dear sir cried the king ""nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire"""
178,178,i am glad to hear your majesty say so
179,179,i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand
180,180,your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes
181,181,you have but to name it
182,182,this photograph
183,183,the king stared at him in amazement
184,184,adventure  ii  the redheaded league
185,185,you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially
186,186,i was afraid that you were engaged
187,187,so i am very much so
188,188,then i can wait in the next room
189,189,not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
190,190,your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed
191,191,you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination
192,192,a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting
193,193,you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique
194,194,your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed
195,195,well the snuff then and the freemasonry
196,196,i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin
197,197,ah of course i forgot that but the writing
198,198,what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk
199,199,well but china
200,200,the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple
201,201,i took the paper from him and read as follows
202,202,to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of  a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league  popes court fleet street
203,203,what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
204,204,it is the morning chronicle of april   just two months ago
205,205,very good now mr wilson
206,206,what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes
207,207,his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head
208,208,why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement
209,209,he is still with you i presume
210,210," i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man

 why that i asks"
211,211," have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open

 never"
212,212," why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies

 and what are they worth i asked"
213,213,"your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff ""pray continue your very interesting statement"""
214,214," my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family

i answered that i had not"
215,215," what would be the hours i asked

 ten to two"
216,216," is  a week

 and the work"
217,217," is purely nominal

 what do you call purely nominal"
218,218," no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet

 and the work"
219,219,eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end
220,220,to an end
221,221,yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself
222,222,he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion
223,223,the redheaded league
224,224,is
225,225,dissolved
226,226," what the redheaded man

 yes"
227,227," oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday

 where could i find him"
228,228,and what did you do then asked holmes
229,229,i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you
230,230,no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds
231,231,we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you
232,232,about a month then
233,233,how did he come
234,234,in answer to an advertisement
235,235,was he the only applicant
236,236,no i had a dozen
237,237,why did you pick him
238,238,because he was handy and would come cheap
239,239,at half wages in fact
240,240,yes
241,241,what is he like this vincent spaulding
242,242,small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
243,243,yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad
244,244,oh yes sir i have only just left him
245,245,and has your business been attended to in your absence
246,246,nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning
247,247,that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion
248,248,"i make nothing of it i answered frankly ""it is a most mysterious business"""
249,249,what are you going to do then i asked
250,250,i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing
251,251,then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along
252,252,not him
253,253,what then
254,254,the knees of his trousers
255,255,and what did you see
256,256,what i expected to see
257,257,why did you beat the pavement
258,258,my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it
259,259,you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged
260,260,yes it would be as well
261,261,and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious
262,262,why serious
263,263,a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight
264,264,at what time
265,265,ten will be early enough
266,266,i shall be at baker street at ten
267,267,"were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way ""our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down"""
268,268,i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily
269,269,john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet
270,270,i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second
271,271,sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street
272,272,you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
273,273,"it is our french gold whispered the director ""we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it"""
274,274,your french gold
275,275,yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose  napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains  napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
276,276,and sit in the dark
277,277,i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carree you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down
278,278,i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
279,279,then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait
280,280,"its no use john clay said holmes blandly ""you have no chance at all"""
281,281,there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes
282,282,oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you
283,283,"and i you holmes answered ""your redheaded idea was very new and effective"""
284,284,"youll see your pal again presently said jones ""hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies"""
285,285,that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
286,286,but how could you guess what the motive was
287,287,and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked
288,288,well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight
289,289,and you are a benefactor of the race said i
290,290,adventure  iii  a case of identity
291,291,it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems
292,292,and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest
293,293,some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken
294,294,i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel
295,295,yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself
296,296,and your mother is alive
297,297,oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got  for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive
298,298,oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying   per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest
299,299,i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
300,300,oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way
301,301,i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel
302,302,yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more
303,303,no
304,304,well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet
305,305,but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you
306,306,well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know
307,307,were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
308,308,oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand
309,309,what office
310,310,thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know
311,311,where did he live then
312,312,he slept on the premises
313,313,and you dont know his address
314,314,noexcept that it was leadenhall street
315,315,where did you address your letters then
316,316,to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of
317,317,"it was most suggestive said holmes ""it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel"""
318,318,he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare
319,319,well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france
320,320,mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
321,321,it missed him then
322,322,yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived
323,323,ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church
324,324,yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him
325,325,it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes
326,326,oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it
327,327,most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
328,328,yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened
329,329,but you have no notion as to what it could have been
330,330,none
331,331,one more question how did your mother take the matter
332,332,she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again
333,333,and your father did you tell him
334,334,yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it
335,335,then you dont think ill see him again
336,336,i fear not
337,337,then what has happened to him
338,338,you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
339,339,"i advertised for him in last saturdays chronicle said she ""here is the slip and here are four letters from him"""
340,340,thank you and your address
341,341,no  lyon place camberwell
342,342,mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business
343,343,he travels for westhouse  marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street
344,344,thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life
345,345,you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back
346,346,you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked
347,347,not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it
348,348,well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way
349,349,sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled
350,350, pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her
351,351,it surprised me
352,352,but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry
353,353,i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel
354,354,i held the little printed slip to the light
355,355,they are typewritten i remarked
356,356,not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive
357,357,of what
358,358,my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case
359,359,i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted
360,360,no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
361,361,well have you solved it i asked as i entered
362,362,yes it was the bisulphate of baryta
363,363,no no the mystery i cried
364,364,oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel
365,365,who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland
366,366,"this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes ""he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in"""
367,367,yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel
368,368,"on the contrary said holmes quietly ""i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel"""
369,369,"it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor ""we never thought that she would have been so carried away"""
370,370,very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank
371,371,i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked
372,372,well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction
373,373,and how did you verify them
374,374,having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse  marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe james windibank voila tout
375,375,and miss sutherland
376,376,if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world
377,377,adventure iv the boscombe valley mystery
378,378,have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 
379,379,i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present
380,380,oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases
381,381,have you heard anything of the case he asked
382,382,not a word i have not seen a paper for some days
383,383,the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
384,384,that sounds a little paradoxical
385,385,but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
386,386,it is a murder then
387,387,the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt
388,388,"i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked ""if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here"""
389,389,how on earth
390,390,my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my metier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering
391,391,what are they
392,392,it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury
393,393,it was a confession i ejaculated
394,394,no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
395,395,coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
396,396,what is the young mans own account of the matter
397,397,it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself
398,398,"the coroner what did you understand by that

witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious"
399,399,"the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel

witness i should prefer not to answer"
400,400,"the coroner i am afraid that i must press it

witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed"
401,401,"the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise

witness i must still refuse"
402,402,"the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father

witness it was"
403,403,"the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol

witness with considerable confusion i do not know"
404,404,"a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured

witness nothing definite"
405,405," how far from the body

 a dozen yards or so"
406,406," and how far from the edge of the wood

 about the same"
407,407,this concluded the examination of the witness
408,408,"it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered ""it is entirely a question of barometric pressure"""
409,409,"i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes ""you may rely upon my doing all that i can"""
410,410,but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent
411,411,i think that it is very probable
412,412,in what way asked holmes
413,413,it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them
414,414,"and your father asked holmes ""was he in favour of such a union"""
415,415,"thank you for this information said he ""may i see your father if i call tomorrow"""
416,416,i am afraid the doctor wont allow it
417,417,the doctor
418,418,yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria
419,419,ha in victoria that is important
420,420,yes at the mines
421,421,quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money
422,422,yes certainly
423,423,thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me
424,424,you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
425,425,i will miss turner
426,426,"i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes ""have you an order to see him in prison"""
427,427,yes but only for you and me
428,428,then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight
429,429,ample
430,430,then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
431,431,and what did you learn from him
432,432,nothing
433,433,could he throw no light
434,434,none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
435,435,ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered
436,436,but if he is innocent who has done it
437,437,ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow
438,438,an elderly man i presume said holmes
439,439,about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free
440,440,indeed that is interesting said holmes
441,441,oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
442,442,really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that
443,443,"you are right said holmes demurely ""you do find it very hard to tackle the facts"""
444,444,anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth
445,445,and that is
446,446,that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
447,447,what did you go into the pool for he asked
448,448,i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth
449,449,i see no marks
450,450,there are none
451,451,how do you know then
452,452,the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon
453,453,and the murderer
454,454,is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
455,455,and leave your case unfinished
456,456,no finished
457,457,but the mystery
458,458,it is solved
459,459,who was the criminal then
460,460,the gentleman i describe
461,461,but who is he
462,462,surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood
463,463,"all right said holmes quietly ""i have given you the chance here are your lodgings goodbye i shall drop you a line before i leave"""
464,464,pray do so
465,465,well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
466,466,what of this cooee then
467,467,well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia
468,468,what of the rat then
469,469,arat i read
470,470,and now he raised his hand
471,471,ballarat
472,472,quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat
473,473,it is wonderful i exclaimed
474,474,it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak
475,475,certainly
476,476,and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
477,477,quite so
478,478,then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
479,479,but how did you gain them
480,480,you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles
481,481,his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces
482,482,yes they were peculiar boots
483,483,but his lameness
484,484,the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame
485,485,but his lefthandedness
486,486,you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of  different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam
487,487,and the cigarholder
488,488,i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife
489,489,"pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently ""you had my note"""
490,490,yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
491,491,i thought people would talk if i went to the hall
492,492,"the old man sank his face in his hands ""god help me"" he cried ""but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes"""
493,493,i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely
494,494,i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested
495,495,it may not come to that said holmes
496,496,what
497,497,i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however
498,498,"i am a dying man said old turner ""i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol"""
499,499,"well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out ""i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation"""
500,500,i pray not sir and what do you intend to do
501,501,in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
502,502,adventure  v  the five orange pips
503,503,"except yourself i have none he answered ""i do not encourage visitors"""
504,504,a client then
505,505,if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys
506,506,come in said he
507,507,yes from horsham
508,508,that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
509,509,i have come for advice
510,510,that is easily got
511,511,and help
512,512,that is not always so easy
513,513,i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal
514,514,ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
515,515,he said that you could solve anything
516,516,he said too much
517,517,that you are never beaten
518,518,i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman
519,519,but what is that compared with the number of your successes
520,520,it is true that i have been generally successful
521,521,then you may be so with me
522,522,i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
523,523,it is no ordinary one
524,524,none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal
525,525,and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
526,526,the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
527,527,well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some  which lay to his credit at the bank
528,528,the letter arrived on march   his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd
529,529,thank you pray proceed
530,530," and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort

 then let me do so"
531,531,it was in january  that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
532,532,"this is the envelope he continued ""the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial """
533,533,what have you done asked holmes
534,534,nothing
535,535,nothing
536,536,i have seen the police
537,537,ah
538,538,but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
539,539,"holmes shook his clenched hands in the air ""incredible imbecility"" he cried"
540,540,they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me
541,541,has he come with you tonight
542,542,no his orders were to stay in the house
543,543,again holmes raved in the air
544,544,i did not know it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
545,545,it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us
546,546,"th set the pips on mccauley paramore and

        john swain of st augustine

th mccauley cleared"
547,547,"th john swain cleared

th visited paramore all well"""
548,548,what shall i do
549,549,there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand
550,550,entirely
551,551,do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
552,552,do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back
553,553,by train from waterloo
554,554,it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
555,555,i am armed
556,556,that is well tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case
557,557,i shall see you at horsham then
558,558,no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it
559,559,save perhaps the sign of four
560,560,well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos
561,561,there can be no question as to their nature he answered
562,562,then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family
563,563,the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
564,564,from east london what do you deduce from that
565,565,they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship
566,566,excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything
567,567,a greater distance to travel
568,568,but the letter had also a greater distance to come
569,569,then i do not see the point
570,570,there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
571,571,it is possible
572,572,more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
573,573,the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society
574,574,but of what society
575,575,i never have
576,576,then the page we have seen
577,577,is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
578,578,what steps will you take i asked
579,579,it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all
580,580,you will not go there first
581,581,no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
582,582,to the police
583,583,no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before
584,584,you are hungry i remarked
585,585,starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast
586,586,nothing
587,587,not a bite i had no time to think of it
588,588,and how have you succeeded
589,589,well
590,590,you have a clue
591,591,i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them it is well thought of
592,592,what do you mean
593,593,and who is this captain calhoun
594,594,the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first
595,595,how did you trace it then
596,596,texas i think
597,597,i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin
598,598,what then
599,599,i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january  my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
600,600,yes
601,601,the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
602,602,what will you do then
603,603,oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
604,604,adventure  vi  the man with the twisted lip
605,605,"a patient said she ""youll have to go out"""
606,606,i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse
607,607,it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed
608,608,oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him
609,609,nearly eleven
610,610,of what day
611,611,of friday june th
612,612,good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key
613,613,i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself
614,614,so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate give me your hand have you a cab
615,615,yes i have one waiting
616,616,then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself
617,617,"as low as you can he answered ""i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you"""
618,618,i have a cab outside
619,619,then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes
620,620,i was certainly surprised to find you there
621,621,but not more so than i to find you
622,622,i came to find a friend
623,623,and i to find an enemy
624,624,an enemy
625,625,yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights
626,626,what you do not mean bodies
627,627,if i can be of use
628,628,oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one
629,629,the cedars
630,630,yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry
631,631,where is it then
632,632,near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us
633,633,but i am all in the dark
634,634,of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then
635,635,you forget that i know nothing about it
636,636,i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
637,637,proceed then
638,638,it is very clear
639,639,so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
640,640,"but a cripple said i ""what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life"""
641,641,he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
642,642,pray continue your narrative
643,643,i cannot imagine
644,644,no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies pennies and  halfpennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
645,645,but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone
646,646,no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared
647,647,it certainly sounds feasible
648,648,well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
649,649,but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked
650,650,because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa
651,651,no good news
652,652,none
653,653,no bad
654,654,no
655,655,thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day
656,656,this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation
657,657,certainly madam
658,658,do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion
659,659,upon what point
660,660,in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive
661,661,frankly then madam i do not
662,662,you think that he is dead
663,663,i do
664,664,murdered
665,665,i dont say that perhaps
666,666,and on what day did he meet his death
667,667,on monday
668,668,then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today
669,669,sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised
670,670,what he roared
671,671,may i see it
672,672,certainly
673,673,no but the enclosure is
674,674,i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address
675,675,how can you tell that
676,676,the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here
677,677,yes there was a ring his signetring
678,678,and you are sure that this is your husbands hand
679,679,one of his hands
680,680,one
681,681,his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well
682,682, dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patienceneville written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam
683,683,none neville wrote those words
684,684,and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over
685,685,but he must be alive mr holmes
686,686,unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him
687,687,no no it is it is his very own writing
688,688,very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted today
689,689,that is possible
690,690,if so much may have happened between
691,691,oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death
692,692,i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you
693,693,i cannot imagine it is unthinkable
694,694,and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you
695,695,no
696,696,and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane
697,697,very much so
698,698,was the window open
699,699,yes
700,700,then he might have called to you
701,701,he might
702,702,he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry
703,703,yes
704,704,a call for help you thought
705,705,yes he waved his hands
706,706,but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands
707,707,it is possible
708,708,and you thought he was pulled back
709,709,he disappeared so suddenly
710,710,he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room
711,711,no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs
712,712,quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on
713,713,but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat
714,714,had he ever spoken of swandam lane
715,715,never
716,716,had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium
717,717,never
718,718,thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow
719,719,awake watson he asked
720,720,yes
721,721,game for a morning drive
722,722,certainly
723,723,as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse
724,724,who is on duty asked holmes
725,725,inspector bradstreet sir
726,726,what can i do for you mr holmes
727,727,i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee
728,728,yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
729,729,so i heard you have him here
730,730,in the cells
731,731,is he quiet
732,732,oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel
733,733,dirty
734,734,yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it
735,735,i should like to see him very much
736,736,would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag
737,737,no i think that ill take it
738,738,"the third on the right is his said the inspector ""here it is"" he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through"
739,739,"he is asleep said he ""you can see him very well"""
740,740,hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector
741,741,he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector
742,742,now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
743,743,if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained
744,744,"no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes ""you would have done better to have trusted you wife"""
745,745,sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder
746,746,i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear
747,747,that note only reached her yesterday said holmes
748,748,good god what a week she must have spent
749,749,many times but what was a fine to me
750,750,i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
751,751,in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results
752,752,vii  the adventure of the blue carbuncle
753,753,"you are engaged said i ""perhaps i interrupt you"""
754,754,"not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat""but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction"""
755,755,precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire
756,756,yes
757,757,it is to him that this trophy belongs
758,758,it is his hat
759,759,no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose
760,760,which surely he restored to their owner
761,761,my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
762,762,what then did peterson do
763,763,he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner
764,764,did he not advertise
765,765,no
766,766,then what clue could you have as to his identity
767,767,only as much as we can deduce
768,768,from his hat
769,769,precisely
770,770,but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt
771,771,here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article
772,772,on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences
773,773,then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat
774,774,my dear holmes
775,775,you are certainly joking holmes
776,776,not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained
777,777,i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual
778,778,the decline of his fortunes then
779,779,this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world
780,780,well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression
781,781,your reasoning is certainly plausible
782,782,the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training
783,783,but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him
784,784,this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection
785,785,but he might be a bachelor
786,786,nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg
787,787,you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house
788,788,one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied
789,789,the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped
790,790,eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face
791,791,a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty
792,792,its more than a precious stone it is the precious stone
793,793,not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated
794,794,precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of  is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
795,795,a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us
796,796,that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
797,797,it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked
798,798,hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner  plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court
799,799,what will you say
800,800,give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at  this evening at b baker street that is clear and concise
801,801,very but will he see it
802,802,well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers
803,803,in which sir
804,804,oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you
805,805,very well sir and this stone
806,806,ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring
807,807,do you think that this man horner is innocent
808,808,i cannot tell
809,809,well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter
810,810,it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
811,811,and you can do nothing until then
812,812,nothing
813,813,in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
814,814,very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop
815,815,yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat
816,816,very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it
817,817,to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
818,818,yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well
819,819,oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief
820,820,of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish
821,821,sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
822,822,not particularly
823,823,then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
824,824,by all means
825,825,your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he
826,826,my geese the man seemed surprised
827,827,yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club
828,828,ah yes i see but you see sir thems not our geese
829,829,indeed whose then
830,830,well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden
831,831,indeed i know some of them which was it
832,832,breckinridge is his name
833,833,ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house goodnight
834,834,goodevening its a cold night said holmes
835,835,the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
836,836,let you have five hundred tomorrow morning
837,837,thats no good
838,838,well there are some on the stall with the gasflare
839,839,ah but i was recommended to you
840,840,who by
841,841,the landlord of the alpha
842,842,oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen
843,843,fine birds they were too now where did you get them from
844,844,to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
845,845,it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha
846,846,well then i shant tell you so now
847,847,oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle
848,848,warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them
849,849,well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman
850,850,its nothing of the kind
851,851,i say it is
852,852,i dont believe it
853,853,dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred
854,854,youll never persuade me to believe that
855,855,will you bet then
856,856,its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate
857,857,well
858,858,thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me
859,859,mrs oakshott  brixton road read holmes
860,860,quite so now turn that up in the ledger
861,861,now then whats the last entry
862,862, december nd twentyfour geese at s d 
863,863,quite so there you are and underneath
864,864, sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s 
865,865,what have you to say now
866,866,no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man
867,867,well then ask mrs oakshott for it
868,868,she told me to ask you
869,869,who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice
870,870,you who are you how could you know anything of the matter
871,871,my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know
872,872,but you can know nothing of this
873,873,excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member
874,874,"oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers ""i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter"""
875,875,precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
876,876,yes sir
877,877,or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail
878,878,it came here
879,879,here
880,880,yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum
881,881,i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars
882,882,it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice
883,883,i seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then
884,884,i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down
885,885,hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety
886,886,get out said he
887,887,what sir oh heaven bless you
888,888,no more words get out
889,889,viii  the adventure of the speckled band
890,890,what is it thena fire
891,891,no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
892,892,my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
893,893,what then
894,894,you know me then
895,895,no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station
896,896,the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
897,897,i am all attention madam
898,898,my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
899,899,your sister is dead then
900,900,she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
901,901,pray be precise as to details said he
902,902,it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain
903,903,perfectly so
904,904,"indeed said holmes ""was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night"""
905,905,always
906,906,and why
907,907,i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
908,908,quite so pray proceed with your statement
909,909,i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
910,910,that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
911,911,was your sister dressed
912,912,no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox
913,913,showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to
914,914,he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
915,915,how about poison
916,916,the doctors examined her for it but without success
917,917,what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
918,918,it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
919,919,were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
920,920,yes there are nearly always some there
921,921,ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band
922,922,sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
923,923,holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
924,924,"these are very deep waters said he ""pray go on with your narrative"""
925,925,two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
926,926,"you have done wisely said my friend ""but have you told me all"""
927,927,yes all
928,928,miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather
929,929,why what do you mean
930,930,you have been cruelly used said holmes
931,931,as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
932,932,excellent you are not averse to this trip watson
933,933,by no means
934,934,then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself
935,935,i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming
936,936,and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast
937,937,no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
938,938,it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
939,939,dark enough and sinister enough
940,940,yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
941,941,what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
942,942,i cannot think
943,943,when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
944,944,but what then did the gipsies do
945,945,i cannot imagine
946,946,i see many objections to any such theory
947,947,and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil
948,948,which of you is holmes asked this apparition
949,949,my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly
950,950,i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran
951,951,"indeed doctor said holmes blandly ""pray take a seat"""
952,952,i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you
953,953,it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes
954,954,what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously
955,955,but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably
956,956,my friend smiled
957,957,holmes the busybody
958,958,his smile broadened
959,959,holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice
960,960,fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
961,961,look there said he
962,962,stoke moran said he
963,963,yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver
964,964,"there is some building going on there said holmes ""that is where we are going"""
965,965,so it appears
966,966,he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns
967,967,he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
968,968,this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber
969,969,exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one
970,970,pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
971,971,there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
972,972,ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course
973,973,yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through
974,974,as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters
975,975,it goes to the housekeepers room
976,976,it looks newer than the other things
977,977,yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
978,978,your sister asked for it i suppose
979,979,no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
980,980,why its a dummy said he
981,981,wont it ring
982,982,no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
983,983,how very absurd i never noticed that before
984,984,that is also quite modern said the lady
985,985,done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes
986,986,yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
987,987,they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
988,988,my stepfathers business papers
989,989,oh you have seen inside then
990,990,only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers
991,991,there isnt a cat in it for example
992,992,no what a strange idea
993,993,well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
994,994,no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon
995,995,ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
996,996,what do you make of that watson
997,997,its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied
998,998,that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
999,999,i shall most certainly do so
1000,1000,the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance
1001,1001,i assure you that i am in your hands
1002,1002,in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
1003,1003,both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment
1004,1004,yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there
1005,1005,yes that is the crown
1006,1006,very good your windows would be visible from there
1007,1007,certainly
1008,1008,you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
1009,1009,oh yes easily
1010,1010,the rest you will leave in our hands
1011,1011,but what will you do
1012,1012,we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
1013,1013,perhaps i have
1014,1014,then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death
1015,1015,i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
1016,1016,you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
1017,1017,no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
1018,1018,can i be of assistance
1019,1019,your presence might be invaluable
1020,1020,then i shall certainly come
1021,1021,it is very kind of you
1022,1022,you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
1023,1023,no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did
1024,1024,i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
1025,1025,you saw the ventilator too
1026,1026,yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
1027,1027,i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
1028,1028,my dear holmes
1029,1029,oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator
1030,1030,but what harm can there be in that
1031,1031,well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you
1032,1032,i cannot as yet see any connection
1033,1033,did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed
1034,1034,no
1035,1035,it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
1036,1036,i cannot say that i have
1037,1037,the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull
1038,1038,subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
1039,1039,"my god i whispered ""did you see it"""
1040,1040,holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
1041,1041,"it is a nice household he murmured ""that is the baboon"""
1042,1042,the least sound would be fatal to our plans
1043,1043,i nodded to show that i had heard
1044,1044,we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator
1045,1045,i nodded again
1046,1046,do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
1047,1047,i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
1048,1048,"you see it watson he yelled ""you see it"""
1049,1049,what can it mean i gasped
1050,1050,the band the speckled band whispered holmes
1051,1051,i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
1052,1052,with the result of driving it through the ventilator
1053,1053,and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
1054,1054,ix  the adventure of the engineers thumb
1055,1055,"stop it i cried ""pull yourself together"" and i poured out some water from a caraffe"
1056,1056,i have been making a fool of myself he gasped
1057,1057,yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
1058,1058,excellent you should have been a surgeon
1059,1059,it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province
1060,1060,a thing like a cleaver said he
1061,1061,an accident i presume
1062,1062,by no means
1063,1063,what a murderous attack
1064,1064,very murderous indeed
1065,1065,you horrify me
1066,1066,how is that i asked when i had finished
1067,1067,capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through
1068,1068,perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves
1069,1069,oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done
1070,1070,ill do better ill take you round to him myself
1071,1071,i should be immensely obliged to you
1072,1072,well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it
1073,1073,yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story
1074,1074," i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips

 how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked"
1075,1075," the work appears to be light and the pay munificent

 precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train"
1076,1076," very good

 i shall come down in a carriage to meet you"
1077,1077,"i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do

 quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers"
1078,1078,one horse interjected holmes
1079,1079,yes only one
1080,1080,did you observe the colour
1081,1081,yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut
1082,1082,tiredlooking or fresh
1083,1083,oh fresh and glossy
1084,1084,thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement
1085,1085,"i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me

 what are you doing there he asked"
1086,1086,we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings
1087,1087,"good heavens cried my patient ""then that explains what the girl said"""
1088,1088,undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford
1089,1089,it was an hours good drive
1090,1090,and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious
1091,1091,they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
1092,1092,i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life
1093,1093,i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly
1094,1094,and i say east said my patient
1095,1095,"i am for west remarked the plainclothes man ""there are several quiet little villages up there"""
1096,1096,you are all wrong
1097,1097,but we cant all be
1098,1098,"oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle ""this is where we shall find them"""
1099,1099,but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley
1100,1100,six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
1101,1101,"indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully ""of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang"""
1102,1102,a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way
1103,1103,yes sir said the stationmaster
1104,1104,when did it break out
1105,1105,i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
1106,1106,whose house is it
1107,1107,dr bechers
1108,1108,x  the adventure of the noble bachelor
1109,1109,he broke the seal and glanced over the contents
1110,1110,oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all
1111,1111,not social then
1112,1112,no distinctly professional
1113,1113,and from a noble client
1114,1114,one of the highest in england
1115,1115,my dear fellow i congratulate you
1116,1116,i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not
1117,1117,it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding
1118,1118,oh yes with the deepest interest
1119,1119,oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections
1120,1120,here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all
1121,1121,there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress 
1122,1122,oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride
1123,1123,before the what asked holmes with a start
1124,1124,the vanishing of the lady
1125,1125,when did she vanish then
1126,1126,at the wedding breakfast
1127,1127,indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact
1128,1128,yes it struck me as being a little out of the common
1129,1129,they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details
1130,1130,i warn you that they are very incomplete
1131,1131,perhaps we may make them less so
1132,1132, the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride 
1133,1133,and is that all
1134,1134,only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one
1135,1135,and it is
1136,1136,that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press
1137,1137,and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory
1138,1138,a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society
1139,1139,no i am descending
1140,1140,i beg pardon
1141,1141,my last client of the sort was a king
1142,1142,oh really i had no idea and which king
1143,1143,the king of scandinavia
1144,1144,what had he lost his wife
1145,1145,of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion
1146,1146,thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride
1147,1147,but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
1148,1148,pray do so
1149,1149,when did you first meet miss hatty doran
1150,1150,in san francisco a year ago
1151,1151,you were travelling in the states
1152,1152,yes
1153,1153,did you become engaged then
1154,1154,no
1155,1155,but you were on a friendly footing
1156,1156,i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused
1157,1157,her father is very rich
1158,1158,he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope
1159,1159,and how did he make his money
1160,1160,in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds
1161,1161,now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character
1162,1162,have you her photograph
1163,1163,the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance
1164,1164,yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her
1165,1165,she brought i understand a considerable dowry
1166,1166,a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family
1167,1167,and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli
1168,1168,i really have made no inquiries on the subject
1169,1169,very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding
1170,1170,yes
1171,1171,was she in good spirits
1172,1172,never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives
1173,1173,indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding
1174,1174,she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony
1175,1175,and did you observe any change in her then
1176,1176,well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
1177,1177,pray let us have it for all that
1178,1178,oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
1179,1179,indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then
1180,1180,oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open
1181,1181,this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends
1182,1182,no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point
1183,1183,lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house
1184,1184,i saw her in conversation with her maid
1185,1185,and who is her maid
1186,1186,alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her
1187,1187,a confidential servant
1188,1188,a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way
1189,1189,how long did she speak to this alice
1190,1190,oh a few minutes i had something else to think of
1191,1191,you did not overhear what they said
1192,1192,lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant
1193,1193,american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid
1194,1194,she walked into the breakfastroom
1195,1195,on your arm
1196,1196,no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back
1197,1197,but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
1198,1198,quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning
1199,1199,ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her
1200,1200,did your wife hear all this
1201,1201,no thank goodness she did not
1202,1202,and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
1203,1203,yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
1204,1204,well it is a possible supposition
1205,1205,you think so too
1206,1206,i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely
1207,1207,i do not think flora would hurt a fly
1208,1208,still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place
1209,1209,well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
1210,1210,in short that she had become suddenly deranged
1211,1211,well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion
1212,1212,we could see the other side of the road and the park
1213,1213,quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you
1214,1214,i have solved it
1215,1215,eh what was that
1216,1216,i say that i have solved it
1217,1217,where then is my wife
1218,1218,that is a detail which i shall speedily supply
1219,1219,my dear holmes
1220,1220,i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example
1221,1221,but i have heard all that you have heard
1222,1222,without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box
1223,1223,"whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye ""you look dissatisfied"""
1224,1224,and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business
1225,1225,really you surprise me
1226,1226,who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day
1227,1227,and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket
1228,1228,yes i have been dragging the serpentine
1229,1229,in heavens name what for
1230,1230,in search of the body of lady st simon
1231,1231,sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily
1232,1232,have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked
1233,1233,why what do you mean
1234,1234,because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
1235,1235,oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter
1236,1236,i think it very unlikely
1237,1237,no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
1238,1238,by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this
1239,1239,at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance
1240,1240,i am afraid that you will find it difficult
1241,1241,and how
1242,1242,extremely so i congratulate you warmly
1243,1243,on the contrary this is the right side
1244,1244,the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here
1245,1245,and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply
1246,1246,very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again
1247,1247,you seem to expect company they have laid for five
1248,1248,"yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he ""i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs"""
1249,1249,my messenger reached you then asked holmes
1250,1250,yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say
1251,1251,the best possible
1252,1252,lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead
1253,1253,it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation
1254,1254,ah you look on these things from another standpoint
1255,1255,i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis
1256,1256,you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position
1257,1257,i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used
1258,1258,pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly
1259,1259,oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar
1260,1260,perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter
1261,1261,when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
1262,1262,"i saw it in a paper explained the american ""it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived"""
1263,1263,then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me
1264,1264,then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go
1265,1265,oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him
1266,1266,you were not yourself at fault at all then
1267,1267,from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter
1268,1268,and how in the world did you find them
1269,1269,it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels
1270,1270,how did you deduce the select
1271,1271,by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to  gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment
1272,1272,"but with no very good result i remarked ""his conduct was certainly not very gracious"""
1273,1273,xi  the adventure of the beryl coronet
1274,1274,"what on earth can be the matter with him i asked ""he is looking up at the numbers of the houses"""
1275,1275,here
1276,1276,no doubt you think me mad said he
1277,1277,i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes
1278,1278,god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair
1279,1279," mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money

 the firm does so when the security is good i answered"
1280,1280," precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security

i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client"
1281,1281," you doubt its value he asked

 not at all i only doubt"
1282,1282," the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient

 ample"
1283,1283," where have you put it asked arthur

 in my own bureau"
1284,1284,on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid
1285,1285," there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he

 there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece"
1286,1286," you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world

 you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried halfmad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom"
1287,1287,do you receive much company he asked
1288,1288,none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think
1289,1289,do you go out much in society
1290,1290,arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it
1291,1291,that is unusual in a young girl
1292,1292,she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is fourandtwenty
1293,1293,this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also
1294,1294,terrible she is even more affected than i
1295,1295,you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt
1296,1296,how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
1297,1297,i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
1298,1298,yes it was twisted
1299,1299,do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it
1300,1300,god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so
1301,1301,precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep
1302,1302,they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door
1303,1303,a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems
1304,1304,they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them
1305,1305,have they thought of looking outside the house
1306,1306,yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined
1307,1307,you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked
1308,1308,no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom
1309,1309,but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly
1310,1310,why is he silent then if he is innocent
1311,1311,who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him
1312,1312,how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
1313,1313,oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison
1314,1314,i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it
1315,1315,no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now
1316,1316,pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up
1317,1317,you heard nothing yourself last night
1318,1318,nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down
1319,1319,you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows
1320,1320,yes
1321,1321,were they all fastened this morning
1322,1322,yes
1323,1323,you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him
1324,1324,yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet
1325,1325,i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery
1326,1326,wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume
1327,1327,yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom
1328,1328,do you know him
1329,1329,oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper
1330,1330,yes he did
1331,1331,and he is a man with a wooden leg
1332,1332,"i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he ""i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up"""
1333,1333,that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom
1334,1334,have you it here
1335,1335,that is it on the dressingtable
1336,1336,sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau
1337,1337,i do not know what to think it is all dark to me
1338,1338,but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder
1339,1339,i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity
1340,1340,your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him
1341,1341,he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
1342,1342,thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
1343,1343,"i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he ""i can serve you best by returning to my rooms"""
1344,1344,but the gems mr holmes where are they
1345,1345,i cannot tell
1346,1346,"the banker wrung his hands ""i shall never see them again"" he cried ""and my son you give me hopes"""
1347,1347,my opinion is in no way altered
1348,1348,then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night
1349,1349,if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw
1350,1350,i would give my fortune to have them back
1351,1351,very good i shall look into the matter between this and then goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening
1352,1352,"i only looked in as i passed said he ""i am going right on"""
1353,1353,where to
1354,1354,oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late
1355,1355,how are you getting on
1356,1356,oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self
1357,1357,"why it is after nine now i answered ""i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring"""
1358,1358,deserted you
1359,1359,no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles
1360,1360,ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems
1361,1361,you would not think  apiece an excessive sum for them
1362,1362,i would pay ten
1363,1363,that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your checkbook here is a pen better make it out for 
1364,1364,with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
1365,1365,"you have it he gasped ""i am saved i am saved"""
1366,1366,there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly
1367,1367,no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one
1368,1368,then it was not arthur who took them
1369,1369,i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not
1370,1370,you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
1371,1371,he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips
1372,1372,for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery
1373,1373,i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together
1374,1374,my mary impossible
1375,1375,it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening
1376,1376,i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face
1377,1377,as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene
1378,1378,is it possible gasped the banker
1379,1379,you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret
1380,1380,well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks
1381,1381,i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder
1382,1382,precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at  apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work
1383,1383,xii  the adventure of the copper beeches
1384,1384,pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me
1385,1385,"dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully


violet hunter"""
1386,1386,do you know the young lady i asked
1387,1387,not i
1388,1388,it is halfpast ten now
1389,1389,yes and i have no doubt that is her ring
1390,1390,it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also
1391,1391,well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question
1392,1392,pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you
1393,1393," yes sir

 as governess"
1394,1394," yes sir

 and what salary do you ask"
1395,1395," oh no

 or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us"
1396,1396,but you would not advise me to refuse
1397,1397,i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for
1398,1398,what is the meaning of it all mr holmes
1399,1399,ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
1400,1400,well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak
1401,1401,that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
1402,1402,but the money mr holmes the money
1403,1403,well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you  a year when they could have their pick for  there must be some strong reason behind
1404,1404,i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me
1405,1405,oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger
1406,1406,danger what danger do you foresee
1407,1407,"and she would need to be said holmes gravely ""i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past"""
1408,1408,the summons was a brief and urgent one
1409,1409,"please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said ""do come i am at my wits end"
1410,1410,hunter
1411,1411,i should wish to
1412,1412,just look it up then
1413,1413,that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning
1414,1414,are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street
1415,1415,but holmes shook his head gravely
1416,1416,"good heavens i cried ""who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads"""
1417,1417,they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
1418,1418,you horrify me
1419,1419,but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened
1420,1420,no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away
1421,1421,quite so she has her freedom
1422,1422,what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation
1423,1423,i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell
1424,1424,"i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly ""it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me"""
1425,1425,pray tell us what has happened to you
1426,1426,i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose
1427,1427,let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen
1428,1428,in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them
1429,1429,what can you not understand
1430,1430,mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story
1431,1431," no i know no one in these parts

 dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away"
1432,1432,i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road
1433,1433,"pray continue said holmes ""your narrative promises to be a most interesting one"""
1434,1434," my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady

but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him"
1435,1435," why what did you think i asked

 why do you think that i lock this door"
1436,1436," i am sure that i do not know

 it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner"
1437,1437,i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do
1438,1438,is toller still drunk he asked
1439,1439,yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him
1440,1440,that is well and the rucastles go out tonight
1441,1441,yes
1442,1442,is there a cellar with a good strong lock
1443,1443,yes the winecellar
1444,1444,you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman
1445,1445,i will try what is it
1446,1446,we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely
1447,1447,i will do it
1448,1448,excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fianceand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
1449,1449,what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated
1450,1450,my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
1451,1451,we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
1452,1452,have you managed it asked holmes
1453,1453,"there has been some villainy here said holmes ""this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off"""
1454,1454,but how
1455,1455,"but it is impossible said miss hunter ""the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away"""
1456,1456,he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
1457,1457,hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter
1458,1458,i have my revolver said i
1459,1459,mrs toller cried miss hunter
1460,1460,yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted
1461,1461,yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know
1462,1462,then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark
1463,1463,she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be
1464,1464,yes sir
1465,1465,and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler
1466,1466,that was it sir
1467,1467,but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his
1468,1468,mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely
1469,1469,and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
1470,1470,you have it sir just as it happened
1471,1471,this file should be named advshhhtm or advshhzip

1649,1649,our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
1650,1650,is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
1651,1651,do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
1652,1652,study of history in the lower grades if mathematicians followed the
1653,1653,multiplication table and fractions
1654,1654,is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
1655,1655,their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route no teacher of
1656,1656,history will deny this still it is a standing challenge to existing
1657,1657,methods of historical instruction if the study of history cannot be
1658,1658,their subject to the already overloaded curriculum if the successive
1659,1659,historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first textmore
1660,1660,economics
1661,1661,in this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
1662,1662,new high school text in american history our first contribution is one
1663,1663,of omission the timehonored stories of exploration and the
1664,1664,same stories for perhaps the fourth time it is worse than useless it
1665,1665,is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
1666,1666,demonstrated to be progressive in character
1667,1667,in the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles our
1668,1668,reasons for this are simple the strategy of a campaign or of a single
1669,1669,about which experts differ widely in the field of military and naval
1670,1670,operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices to
1671,1671,dispose of gettysburg or the wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
1672,1672,equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs any one who
1673,1673,compares the ordinary textbook account of a single civil war campaign
1674,1674,comment no youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
1675,1675,of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
1676,1676,deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of lifes
1677,1677,serious responsibilities
1678,1678,rather upon constructive features
1679,1679,second we have emphasized those historical topics which help to
1680,1680,explain how our nation has come to be what it is today
1681,1681,third we have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
1682,1682,these are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians these
1683,1683,are matters which civilians can understandmatters which they must
1684,1684,enlarge the treatment of our own time we have given special attention
1685,1685,to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
1686,1686,matter of sound instruction in citizenship
1687,1687,reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place
1688,1688,seventh we have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity the
1689,1689,study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory we
1690,1690,intellects of our readersto put them upon their mettle most of them
1691,1691,will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
1692,1692,the world will soon expect maturity from them their achievements will
1693,1693,depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone the
1694,1694,effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
1695,1695,the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their

3969,3969,extremely sensitive they looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
3970,3970,the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
3971,3971,traditions they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
3972,3972,against britain the right of local trial by jury and with what

4009,4009,though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present the
4010,4010,old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures

4023,4023,large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention its
4024,4024,very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
4025,4025,legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed continental congress
4026,4026,"a party of men who had ""marked out for themselves a more indulgent"

4032,4032,should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
4033,4033,tender in the payment of debts the state legislatures had enacted laws
4034,4034,allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or

4179,4179,assumed by the united states government and placed on the same secure

4181,4181,of dollars worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
4182,4182,the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
4183,4183,support of the government or had sold supplies for the revolutionary
4184,4184,army was well known it was also a matter of common knowledge that a
4185,4185,very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
4186,4186,discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
4187,4187,purchasers some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
4188,4188,had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their

4190,4190,but at a figure reasonably above the market price against the

8794,8794,the distribution of the nations wealth and resources
8795,8795,roosevelts view of the constitutionequally significant was
8796,8796,roosevelts attitude toward the constitution and the office of
8797,8797,president he utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national
8798,8798,"charter he held that the constitution ""should be treated as the"
8799,8799,greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in
8800,8800,"straitjacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth"" he viewed the"

8802,8802,that he was not specifically authorized by the constitution to do
8803,8803,roosevelt took exactly the opposite position it was his opinion that it
8804,8804,"was not only the presidents right but his duty ""to do anything that the"
8805,8805,needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the
8806,8806,"constitution or the laws"" he went on to say that he acted ""for the"

8809,8809,especial attention this was unavoidable by far the larger part of the
8810,8810,business of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from
8811,8811,partnerships and individual owners the growth of these gigantic
8812,8812,aggregations of capital had been the leading feature in american
8813,8813,industrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth
8814,8814,"century in the conquest of business by trusts and ""the resulting"
8815,8815,place of democracy the tariff breeds trusts let us destroy therefore
8816,8816,"the tariff and the trusts""such was the battle cry which had been taken"
8817,8817,up by bryan and his followers
8818,8818,president roosevelt countered vigorously he rejected the idea that the
8819,8819,trusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any
8820,8820,"kind he insisted that they were the outcome of ""natural economic"

8825,8825,of immense savings by the union of many plants under one management in
8826,8826,the corporation he saw a new stage in the development of american

8828,8828,which all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is
8829,8829,absurd
8830,8830,"at the same time he proposed that ""evil trusts"" should be prevented from"
8831,8831,competitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses
8832,8832,advantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils
8833,8833,that accompanied it the railway company he declared to be a public
8834,8834,"servant ""its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike"""
8835,8835,so he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations
8836,8836,were private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let
8837,8837,or hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations
8838,8838,could be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution

9719,9719,while the demand arose for the exclusion of the japanese as well in
9720,9720,this case no exclusion law was passed but an understanding was reached
9721,9721,by which japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing
9722,9722,them to come to the united states by act of congress in  the
9723,9723,agitation of the subject they were difficult to enforce and it was

9727,9727,embarrassing position by treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to

9729,9729,international agreement the western states were fixed in their
9730,9730,determination to control oriental residents japan was equally
9731,9731,persistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her
9732,9732,sought a way out of the deadlock

11466,11466,objects of scientific medicine the two great branches of the healing
11467,11467,artmedicine and surgeryare so intimately related that it is
11468,11468,"convenience surgery may be defined as ""the art of treating lesions and"
11469,11469,essential that the surgeon should be conversant not only with the normal
11470,11470,anatomy and physiology of the body and with the various pathological
11471,11471,process by which repair of injured or diseased tissues is effected
11472,11472,without this knowledge he is unable to recognise such deviations from
11473,11473,rationally to direct his efforts towards the correction or removal of
11474,11474,these
11475,11475,process of repair
11476,11476,the process of repair in living tissue depends upon an inherent power
11477,11477,possessed by vital cells of reacting to the irritation caused by injury
11478,11478,designed to restore the normal structure and configuration of the part
11479,11479,the process by which this restoration is effected is essentially the
11480,11480,connective tissue taking the place of what has been lost or destroyed
11481,11481,in a damaged part each element takes its share in the reparative process
11482,11482,by producing new material which approximates more or less closely to the
11483,11483,normal according to the recuperative capacity of the particular tissue
11484,11484,the normal process of repair may be interfered with by various
11485,11485,dressings the effect of these agencies is to delay repair or to prevent
11486,11486,the individual tissues carrying the process to the furthest degree of
11487,11487,which they are capable
11488,11488,in the management of wounds and other diseased conditions the main
11489,11489,object of the surgeon is to promote the natural reparative process by
11490,11490,preventing or eliminating any factor by which it may be disturbed

11638,11638,portion of tissue from one part of the body to another the tissue
11639,11639,transferred is known as the graft or the transplant the simplest
11640,11640,example of grafting is the transplantation of skin
11641,11641,in order that the graft may survive and have a favourable chance of
11642,11642,vitality until it has formed an organic connection with the tissue in

11649,11649,it is instructive to associate the period of survival of the different
11650,11650,grafting purposes the higher tissues such as those of the central
11651,11651,nervous system and highly specialised glandular tissues like those of
11652,11652,the kidney lose their vitality quickly after death and are therefore
11653,11653,all that is required of them the same is true of the skin and its
11654,11654,appendages

11678,11678,healing in the large defects of skin caused by severe burns the
11679,11679,grafting is carried out when the surface is covered by a uniform layer
11680,11680,of healthy granulations and before the inevitable contraction of scar

11694,11694,they are cut with a sharp hollowground razor or with thierschs
11695,11695,moistened with warm saline solution the cutting is made easier if the

11697,11697,solution of one per cent novocain into the line of the lateral and

11699,11699,by means of alcohol followed by saline solution
11700,11700,the strips of epidermis wrinkle up on the knife and are directly
11701,11701,which are then subjected to firm pressure with a pad of gauze to express

19361,19361,which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
19362,19362,had uttered them
19363,19363,he spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be
19364,19364,sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was

20564,20564,rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
20565,20565,know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he

20572,20572,the subject under discussion than those they are talking with
20573,20573,"that letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew
of it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not
then as soon as all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate"

20575,20575,"as the legitimate son"""
20576,20576,"but my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be
the legal heir to everything and you wont get anything you must
know my dear whether the will and letter were written and whether
they have been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been
overlooked you ought to know where they are and must find them
because"
20577,20577,think we are all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot
20578,20578,translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasili the
20579,20579,invalidity of his contention
20580,20580,a bastard
20581,20581,"well really catiche cant you understand you are so
intelligent how is it you dont see that if the count has written a
letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate
it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count
bezukhov and will then inherit everything under the will and if
the will and letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing
but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit
thats certain"
20582,20582,and all that follows therefrom
20583,20583,"i know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and
you mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the"
20584,20584,princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are

20664,20664,had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned
20665,20665,to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed
20666,20666,with a kind of awe and even servility a deference such as he had

20674,20674,majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three
20675,20675,stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the
20676,20676,morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and
20677,20677,whether it was firmly fixed on
20678,20678,"courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is
well and he turned to go"

20684,20684,through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his

20697,20697,"resignation to the will of god ""if you do not understand these"
20698,20698,the men and women had separated as in church all were silently
20699,20699,the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna
20700,20700,that held the taper
20701,20701,remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing
20702,20702,pierre she again began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look
20703,20703,out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in
20704,20704,counts hand got up and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna
20705,20705,lorrain from behind her back the french doctor held no taper he
20706,20706,was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude

20710,20710,resumed their places and the service continued during this interval
20711,20711,pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he had
20712,20712,about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
20713,20713,where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the
20714,20714,returned to their places one after the other before the service was
20715,20715,concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to
20716,20716,what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way
20717,20717,essential
20718,20718,was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received
20719,20719,the sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as
20720,20720,before around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and
20721,20721,pierre heard her say
20722,20722,"certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be
impossible"
20723,20723,servants that pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face
20724,20724,not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service he
20725,20725,judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the
20726,20726,invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him
20727,20727,catch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the
20728,20728,"servants say in a frightened whisper ""catch hold from underneath"
20729,20729,"here"" exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the"
20730,20730,weight they were carrying were too much for them
20731,20731,man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the

20734,20734,had carried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched
20735,20735,which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the
20736,20736,ceremony just completed he lay with his head propped high on the

20739,20739,inquiringly at his guide anna mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with
20740,20740,the counts face stirred once more pierre looked questioningly at
20741,20741,anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next anna mikhaylovna
20742,20742,with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre
20743,20743,mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naively
20744,20744,his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to
20745,20745,at the spot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna
20746,20746,mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the
20747,20747,pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the
20748,20748,seemed an hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the counts
20749,20749,was drawn to one side only now did pierre realize how near death
20750,20750,hoarse sound anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick mans
20751,20751,man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who
20752,20752,stood constantly at the head of the bed
20753,20753,to turn the counts heavy body toward the wall
20754,20754,pierre rose to help him
20755,20755,helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward
20756,20756,whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded
20757,20757,smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling
20758,20758,to his side with his face to the wall he sighed
20759,20759,"princesses was coming to take her turn at watching ""let us go"""
20760,20760,pierre went out

20762,20762,there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili
20763,20763,catherine the great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre
20764,20764,princess hide something as she whispered
20765,20765,i cant bear the sight of that woman
20766,20766,catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said
20767,20767,squeeze below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the
20768,20768,small drawing room
20769,20769,"there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
of this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of"
20770,20770,restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese
20771,20771,handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
20772,20772,in the small circular room around the table all who were at count
20773,20773,bezukhovs house that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre
20774,20774,well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
20775,20775,brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several
20776,20776,times now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one
20777,20777,and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what
20778,20778,was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did not eat anything though
20779,20779,he would very much have liked to he looked inquiringly at his
20780,20780,monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the
20781,20781,reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest
20782,20782,short interval followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside
20783,20783,same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room
20784,20784,but my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but
20785,20785,when he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul
20786,20786,"is already prepared"""
20787,20787,prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar
20788,20788,violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the
20789,20789,two ladies were saying
20790,20790,"come my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases
you know how fond the count is of her"
20791,20791,i dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the
20792,20792,"portfolio she held in her hand ""all i know is that his real will is"
20793,20793,bar her path
20794,20794,portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily
20795,20795,"dear princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je
vous en conjure"
20796,20796,the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the
20797,20797,none of its honeyed firmness and softness
20798,20798,"pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place
in a family consultation is it not so prince"
20799,20799,why dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so
20800,20800,loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled
20801,20801,portfolio
20802,20802,but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold
20803,20803,this is absurd come let go i tell you
20804,20804,the princess let go
20805,20805,and you too
20806,20806,but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him
20807,20807,"let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will
go and ask him i does that satisfy you"
20808,20808,mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her
20809,20809,prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands
20810,20810,out wringing her hands
20811,20811,"what are you doing she cried vehemently ""he is dying and you"
20812,20812,"leave me alone with him"""
20813,20813,quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom
20814,20814,her a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard
20815,20815,showed an irrepressible hatred
20816,20816,"yes now you may be glad said she ""this is what you have been"
20817,20817,"waiting for"" and bursting into tears she hid her face in her"
20818,20818,handkerchief and rushed from the room
20819,20819,prince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre
20820,20820,pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as
20821,20821,if in an ague
20822,20822,was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in
20823,20823,"death is awful"" and he burst into tears"
20824,20824,quiet steps
20825,20825,pierre she said
20826,20826,pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his
20827,20827,he is no more
20828,20828,pierre looked at her over his spectacles
20829,20829,"come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as
tears"
20830,20830,she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one
20831,20831,he was fast asleep with his head on his arm
20832,20832,in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre
20833,20833,"yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you
but god will support you you are young and are now i hope in
command of an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i
know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but
it imposes duties on you and you must be a man"
20834,20834,pierre was silent
20835,20835,"perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not
been there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle
promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris but
he had no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your
fathers wish"
20836,20836,pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
20837,20837,mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking in the
20838,20838,morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details
20839,20839,of count bezukhovs death she said the count had died as she would
20840,20840,know which had behaved better during those awful momentsthe father
20841,20841,who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had
20842,20842,it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count
20843,20843,paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
20844,20844,bourienne though in the new reign he was free to return to the

20847,20847,two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
20848,20848,always going on at his estate as regularity is a prime condition
20849,20849,the highest point of exactitude he always came to table under
20850,20850,a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted
20851,20851,men would have aroused although he was in retirement and had now no
20852,20852,province in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty to
20853,20853,visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber ante chamber just as the
20854,20854,punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in this antechamber
20855,20855,experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the
20856,20856,enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
20857,20857,princess mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed
20858,20858,every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well
20859,20859,an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
20860,20860,"quietly and said in a whisper ""please walk in"""
20861,20861,through the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess
20862,20862,timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused
20863,20863,at the entrance the prince was working at the lathe and after
20864,20864,glancing round continued his work
20865,20865,the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use the
20866,20866,tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall
20867,20867,still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age
20868,20868,after a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the

21470,21470,command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the
21471,21471,room with the required papers kutuzov and the austrian member of

21475,21475,the conversation in french
21476,21476,all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of
21477,21477,expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
21478,21478,deliberately spoken word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened
21479,21479,emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long
21480,21480,ago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to me
21481,21481,personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
21482,21482,of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful

21488,21488,excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by
21489,21489,his majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the
21490,21490,splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have
21491,21491,the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following
21492,21492,we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men
21493,21493,with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech
21494,21494,intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
21495,21495,ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the
21496,21496,fate he deserves
21497,21497,kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at
21498,21498,the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively
21499,21499,done with jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round
21500,21500,at the aidedecamp

21504,21504,stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room
21505,21505,he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his
21506,21506,his former affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man
21507,21507,occupied with agreeable and interesting work his face expressed

advancing"
21517,21517,and why is it

21519,21519,any news from mack
21520,21520,no
21521,21521,if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come
21522,21522,probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door

21530,21530,and kutuzov appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged
21531,21531,vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice
21532,21532,kutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
21533,21533,immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a
21534,21534,the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been
21535,21535,beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be

21538,21538,interest lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack
21539,21539,and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the
21540,21540,he would have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the
21541,21541,thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks
21542,21542,encounter with the french since suvorov met them he feared that
21543,21543,bonapartes genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian
21544,21544,being disgraced
21545,21545,excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward
21546,21546,zherkov they were as usual laughing
21547,21547,why are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince andrews pale
21548,21548,face and glittering eyes

21559,21559,turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
21560,21560,russian army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jest
21561,21561,if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said
21562,21562,your doing so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in

22048,22048,still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher
22049,22049,and how deep how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what
22050,22050,soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone and fairer

22089,22089,with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the
22090,22090,enemy and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems
22091,22091,converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all
22092,22092,mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the

22105,22105,longdesired happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears
22106,22106,seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of
22107,22107,victory then he began to imagine that the russians were running
22108,22108,but that on the contrary the french had run away he again recalled
22109,22109,all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the
22110,22110,was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the
22111,22111,at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded
22112,22112,the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the
22113,22113,being jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he
22114,22114,at the envoy hurrying past them

22116,22116,conversation
22117,22117,on
22118,22118,it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the
22119,22119,that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so
22120,22120,attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and
22121,22121,even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before only his
22122,22122,eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with
22123,22123,extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the
22124,22124,concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to
22125,22125,the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that
22126,22126,might be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be

find the adjutant on duty said the official ""he will conduct you to"
22129,22129,"the minister of war"""
22130,22130,and went in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and
22131,22131,bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along
22132,22132,a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the
22133,22133,adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
22134,22134,attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger
22135,22135,prince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
22136,22136,without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
22137,22137,one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind
22138,22138,instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to
22139,22139,"they probably think it easy to gain victories"" he thought his eyes"
22140,22140,peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened
22141,22141,when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
22142,22142,minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each
22143,22143,side of the ministers bent bald head with its gray temples he went

22145,22145,papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger
22146,22146,prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzovs army
22147,22147,interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he

22150,22150,he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it

22153,22153,"calamity what a calamity"""
22154,22154,having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and
22155,22155,"ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is
not captured again he pondered ""i am very glad you have brought"
22156,22156,thank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the
22157,22157,reappeared
22158,22158,when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and
22159,22159,happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
22160,22160,indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant
22161,22161,the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle
22162,22162,seemed the memory of a remote event long past

22168,22168,after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived
22169,22169,prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious
22170,22170,surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides
22171,22171,in russian for they were speaking french at least with a russian who

22173,22173,as prince andrew they had known each other previously in
22174,22174,vienna with kutuzov just as prince andrew was a young man who gave
22175,22175,greater extent bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic
22176,22176,foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him
22177,22177,he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they
22178,22178,and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his
22179,22179,writing table he worked well whatever the import of his work it
22180,22180,"was not the question ""what for"" but the question ""how"" that"
22181,22181,dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres
22182,22182,made elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to
22183,22183,say something striking and took part in a conversation only when
22184,22184,that was possible his conversation was always sprinkled with
22185,22185,sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a

22187,22187,always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers
22188,22188,after a russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the
22189,22189,principal play of expression on his face now his forehead would
22190,22190,deepset eyes always twinkled and looked out straight
22191,22191,well now tell me about your exploits said he
22192,22192,described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war
22193,22193,"they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
skittles said he in conclusion"
22194,22194,bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared

methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince"

22206,22206,the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and
22207,22207,he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his

orders have been given to blow it up otherwise we should long ago
have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army would

22338,22338,i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there
22339,22339,and you didnt see that everybody is packing up
22340,22340,i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew
22341,22341,impatiently
22342,22342,"whats it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that
auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat
is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or
two"
22343,22343,"what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was
mined"

22345,22345,bolkonski shrugged his shoulders
22346,22346,"but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it
will be cut off said he"
22347,22347,"thats just it answered bilibin ""listen the french entered"

22352,22352,the marshalls
22353,22353,stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news
22354,22354,grieved him and yet he was pleased
22355,22355,as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless
22356,22356,situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead
22357,22357,it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift
22358,22358,him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to
22359,22359,fame listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching
22360,22360,the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be
22361,22361,entrusted with the executing of the plan
22362,22362,stop this jesting he said

22388,22388,and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles

22391,22391,"why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back
to the army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher
it is heroism"
22392,22392,not at all said prince andrew

other side of the question and you will see that your duty on the
contrary is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no

22402,22402,prince andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was
22403,22403,moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder the road was
22404,22404,so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a

22690,22690,battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank
22691,22691,the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if
22692,22692,prince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked
22693,22693,at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers
22694,22694,remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it but

22696,22696,commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses
22697,22697,of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was
22698,22698,in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince

22700,22700,at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with
22701,22701,orders to attack the french but this adjutant returned half an hour

22703,22703,to throw some sharpshooters into the wood

22742,22742,bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had
22743,22743,just passed prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on
22744,22744,prince bagrations face at this moment it expressed the
22745,22745,concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who

should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front"
23821,23821,why

23835,23835,annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile

23856,23856,to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it
23857,23857,home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that
23858,23858,that worried him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he

23945,23945,great many officers like him were always coming there and that
23946,23946,bolkonski prince andrew was in and boris was shown into a large

23950,23950,addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty
23951,23951,and that he should go through the door on the left into the
23952,23952,reception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went
23953,23953,very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to
23954,23954,a cheerful smile
23955,23955,drubetskoy more than ever was boris resolved to serve in future not
23956,23956,now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had
23957,23957,already risen above the general who at the front had the power to
23958,23958,him and took his hand
23959,23959,"i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing
about with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the
dispositions when germans start being accurate theres no end to

23961,23961,"well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have
been thinking about you"
23962,23962,yes i was thinkingfor some reason boris could not help
23963,23963,"blushing""of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter"

23966,23966,that gentlemanevidently not sharing boris conception of the
23967,23967,advantages of the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly
23968,23968,at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he
23969,23969,had to say to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned
23970,23970,away and waited impatiently for prince andrews return from the
23971,23971,commander in chiefs room
23972,23972,you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said
23973,23973,prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the

23979,23979,to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we

23982,23982,prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a
23983,23983,young man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining
23984,23984,success and which attracted him he very readily took up boris
23985,23985,cause and went with him to dolgorukov
23986,23986,it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz
23987,23987,occupied by the emperors and their retinues
23988,23988,that same day a council of war had been held in which all the
23989,23989,members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that
23990,23990,and give battle to bonaparte the council of war was just over when
23991,23991,prince andrew accompanied by boris arrived at the palace to find
23992,23992,dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of
23993,23993,the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for
23994,23994,something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and
23995,23995,their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages
23996,23996,of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe coming
23997,23997,battle and the victory that would certainly result from itno
23998,23998,longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the
23999,23999,by the emperors presence were eager for action the strategic
24000,24000,position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its
24001,24001,details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had
24002,24002,ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on
24003,24003,the very fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacent
24004,24004,of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his
24005,24005,andrew in french

24009,24009,so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonski

has decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received
from him today for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantly"
24011,24011,is that so and what did he say inquired bolkonski
24012,24012,we could not think how to address the reply if not as consul and of
24013,24013,"bonaparte"""
24014,24014,"but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him

24016,24016,"as usurper and enemy of mankind"""
24017,24017,dolgorukov laughed merrily

address he is a wise and clever fellow"

24022,24022,yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski

a more cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of
french adroitness and italian playacting do you know the tale
about him and count markov count markov was the only man who knew how
to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is
delightful"

24033,24033,boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher

24385,24385,do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let
24386,24386,every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these

24390,24390,at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the
24391,24391,which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french
24392,24392,right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to
24393,24393,smart it was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking
24394,24394,with them austrian column guides were moving in and out among the
24395,24395,russian troops and served as heralds of the advance as soon as an
24396,24396,austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officers
24397,24397,ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed
24398,24398,the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and
24399,24399,resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and
24400,24400,to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were
24401,24401,going
24402,24402,a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his
24403,24403,regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has
24404,24404,day of battleheaven knows how and whencea stern note of which
24405,24405,awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of battle the
24406,24406,soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
24407,24407,what is going on around them
24408,24408,the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they
24409,24409,could not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and
24410,24410,might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns
24411,24411,other russian columns were moving in the same direction every soldier
24412,24412,more of our men were going too
24413,24413,there now the kurskies have also gone past was being said in the
24414,24414,ranks
24415,24415,"its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last
night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a
regular moscow"
24416,24416,though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or
24417,24417,exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the
24418,24418,halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder
24419,24419,spread through the ranks how such a consciousness is communicated
24420,24420,water does in a creek had the russian army been alone without any
24421,24421,been occasioned by the sausage eaters
24422,24422,"why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up
against the french"
24423,24423,no one cant hear them theyd be firing if we had
24424,24424,"they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in
the middle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damned
germans muddling what stupid devils"
24425,24425,"yes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding up
behind and now here we stand hungry"
24426,24426,"i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking
the way said an officer"
24427,24427,ah those damned germans they dont know their own country
24428,24428,said another
24429,24429,the eighteenth
24430,24430,"then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you
wont get there till evening"
24431,24431,"what stupid orders they dont themselves know what they are
doing said the officer and rode off"
24432,24432,tafalafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said a
24433,24433,"the scoundrels"""
24434,24434,"we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent
got halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides"
24435,24435,and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
24436,24436,turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
24437,24437,germans
24438,24438,the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was
24439,24439,was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
24440,24440,ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in
24441,24441,at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a
24442,24442,russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry
24443,24443,the hill the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more
24444,24444,and the action at the goldbach stream began
24445,24445,from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in
24446,24446,those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this
24447,24447,it was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a
24448,24448,were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and
24449,24449,schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and
24450,24450,that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man
24451,24451,of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise
24452,24452,out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving
24453,24453,valley not a single muscle of his facewhich in those days was still
24454,24454,thinmoved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot his
24455,24455,predictions were being justified part of the russian force had
24456,24456,already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
24457,24457,part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack
24458,24458,and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that
24459,24459,direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
24460,24460,the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the
24461,24461,already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still
24462,24462,he did not begin the engagement
24463,24463,today was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation
24464,24464,that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
24465,24465,selfcomplacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily
24466,24466,in love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his
24467,24467,floating up out of the mist
24468,24468,mist were aglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to
24469,24469,the french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which
24470,24470,were being more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the
24471,24471,valley to their left
24472,24472,chapter xv
24473,24473,at eight oclock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth
24474,24474,przebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone down
24475,24475,into the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and
24476,24476,lead that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen
24477,24477,forming the commander in chiefs suite he was in a state of
24478,24478,man is at the approach of a longawaited moment he was firmly
24479,24479,would do so the locality and the position of our troops were known to
24480,24480,him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army his own
24481,24481,considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
24482,24482,might call for his rapidity of perception and decision
24483,24483,forces could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight
24484,24484,"me"""
24485,24485,he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
24486,24486,"which i shall lead the army"""
24487,24487,in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights
24488,24488,like a milkwhite sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left
24489,24489,into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of
24490,24490,right the guards were entering the misty region with a sound of
24491,24491,hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to the left
24492,24492,beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared
24493,24493,in the sea of mist in front and behind moved infantry the
24494,24494,commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting
24495,24495,the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemed worn and
24496,24496,irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt without
24497,24497,"do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the
village he said angrily to a general who had ridden up ""dont you"
24498,24498,through narrow village streets when we are marching against the
24499,24499,"enemy"""
24500,24500,i intended to reform them beyond the village your excellency
24501,24501,answered the general
24502,24502,kutuzov laughed bitterly
24503,24503,"youll make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy
very fine"
24504,24504,"the enemy is still far away your excellency according to the
dispositions"
24505,24505,"the dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly ""who told you"
24506,24506,"that kindly do as you are ordered"""
24507,24507,yes sir
24508,24508,"is as surly as a dog"""
24509,24509,an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his
24510,24510,hat galloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperors name had the
24511,24511,fourth column advanced into action
24512,24512,kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to
24513,24513,"go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed
the village tell it to stop and await my orders"
24514,24514,hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him
24515,24515,"and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added ""what"
24516,24516,not replying to the austrian
24517,24517,prince andrew galloped off to execute the order
24518,24518,the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
24519,24519,sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of
24520,24520,the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to
24521,24521,throw out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were
24522,24522,other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six
24523,24523,miles away there was really nothing to be seen in front except a
24524,24524,barren descent hidden by dense mist having given orders in the
24525,24525,butts of their muskets on the ground
24526,24526,the leftflank columns had already descended
24527,24527,plenty of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst
24528,24528,his whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed he put on
24529,24529,the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning with an
24530,24530,affectation of respect which evidently struck alexander
24531,24531,this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy
24532,24532,face of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and
24533,24533,vanished after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than
24534,24534,on the field of olmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time
24535,24535,same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance
24536,24536,of goodhearted innocent youth
24537,24537,at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
24538,24538,brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping
24539,24539,him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his
24540,24540,"white adjutants and asked some question""most likely he is asking"
24541,24541,time at the emperor francis
24542,24542,respectfully
24543,24543,not quite heard
24544,24544,waiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew noted that
24545,24545,kutuzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word
24546,24546,the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his
24547,24547,if complaining of kutuzov
24548,24548,"you know michael ilarionovich we are not on the
empress field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are
assembled said the tsar with another glance at the emperor"
24549,24549,what he was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about
24550,24550,him and did not listen
24551,24551,that is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a
24552,24552,"the empress field"" said clearly and distinctly"
24553,24553,in the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
24554,24554,the gentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french

24556,24556,the emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had
24557,24557,carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the
24558,24558,and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
24559,24559,the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
24560,24560,chapter xvi
24561,24561,kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind
24562,24562,the carabineers
24563,24563,when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column
24564,24564,were marching along both
24565,24565,the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly
24566,24566,visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down
24567,24567,him for a field glass
24568,24568,trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their
24569,24569,faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to
24570,24570,appeared just in front of us
24571,24571,"its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but
how is that said different voices"
24572,24572,dense french column coming up to meet the apsherons
24573,24573,here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come
24574,24574,the apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at
24575,24575,confused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where
24576,24576,five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would
24577,24577,not to be carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to
24578,24578,ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov
24579,24579,remained in the same place and without answering drew out a
24580,24580,handkerchief blood was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced
24581,24581,his way to him
24582,24582,of his lower jaw
24583,24583,handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing
24584,24584,rode to the right
24585,24585,a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it
24586,24586,the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
24587,24587,"are you hindering us"" another in the same place turned round and"
24588,24588,fired in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode
24589,24589,having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of
24590,24590,a sound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the
24591,24591,the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was
24592,24592,still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some
24593,24593,backward with the fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself
24594,24594,from the infantry and approached kutuzov of kutuzovs suite only four
24595,24595,remained they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence
24596,24596,and across kutuzovs suite like a flock of little birds
24597,24597,at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his
24598,24598,the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing
24599,24599,without orders
24600,24600,oh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked around
24601,24601,run to the standard
24602,24602,forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs
24603,24603,hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him
24604,24604,several soldiers fell
24605,24605,battalion would follow him
24606,24606,and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then
24607,24607,"another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting ""hurrah"""
24608,24608,and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
24609,24609,infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning
24610,24610,the guns round prince andrew and the battalion were already within
24611,24611,twenty paces of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above
24612,24612,him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually
24613,24613,groaned and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at
24614,24614,what was going on in front of himat the battery he now saw
24615,24615,pulling one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other
24616,24616,he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the
24617,24617,doing
24618,24618,what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them
24619,24619,"why doesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed why
doesnt the frenchman stab him he will not get away before the
frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him"
24620,24620,triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited
24621,24621,ended it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him
24622,24622,the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his
24623,24623,seeing what he had been looking at
24624,24624,had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or
24625,24625,saved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the
24626,24626,frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do
24627,24627,those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did
24628,24628,not see that lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it
24629,24629,chapter xvii
24630,24630,battle had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs
24631,24631,inquire of the commander in chief bagration knew that as the distance
24632,24632,be able to get back before evening
24633,24633,hurriedly interrupting bagration
24634,24634,on being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a few
24635,24635,generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem
24636,24636,all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be
24637,24637,was full of joy and happiness on receiving the order he gave his
24638,24638,horse the rein and galloped along the line at first he rode along the
24639,24639,were standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by
24640,24640,uvarovs cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation
24641,24641,for battle having passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the
24642,24642,sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder
24643,24643,and louder
24644,24644,that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but
24645,24645,merged into a general roar
24646,24646,he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one
24647,24647,infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons
24648,24648,rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was
24649,24649,or make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men
24650,24650,out these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating
24651,24651,determination
24652,24652,and farther into the region where the army was already in action
24653,24653,how it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought
24654,24654,rostov
24655,24655,after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part
24656,24656,of the line the guards was already in action
24657,24657,so much the better i shall see it close he thought
24658,24658,he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came
24659,24659,galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks
24660,24660,that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many
24661,24661,across his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
24662,24662,the horses were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their
24663,24663,to meet them
24664,24664,horses rostov could already see their faces and heard the command
24665,24665,charge shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to
24666,24666,but still was not in time to avoid them
24667,24667,collide this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his
24668,24668,bedouin over rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to
24669,24669,these gigantic men and horses had it not occurred to rostov to
24670,24670,flourish his whip before the eyes of the guardsmans horse the
24671,24671,ears but the pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in
24672,24672,galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards passed rostov
24673,24673,their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with
24674,24674,immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
24675,24675,enveloped everything
24676,24676,them or to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of
24677,24677,the horse guards that amazed the french themselves rostov was
24678,24678,horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome

25268,25268,expression on dolokhovs face
25269,25269,well how do you feel he asked
25270,25270,bad but its not that my friend said dolokhov with a gasping
25271,25271,who asked rostov
25272,25272,my mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and
25273,25273,dolokhov pressed rostovs hand and burst into tears

25277,25277,pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg
25278,25278,and in moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after
25279,25279,he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
25280,25280,the room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early
25281,25281,"loving her in deceiving yourself and her"" and he vividly recalled"
25282,25282,"he had found so difficult to utter ""i love you"" ""it all comes from"
25283,25283,he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
25284,25284,of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into
25285,25285,his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his
25286,25286,respectful understanding of his employers happiness
25287,25287,beauty so this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did
25288,25288,not understand her how often when considering her character i have
25289,25289,understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of
25290,25290,truth that she is a depraved woman now i have spoken that terrible
25291,25291,word to myself all has become clear
25292,25292,"anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss
her naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself
be kissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she
replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous
let him do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked
her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed
contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children
and that she was not going to have any children by me"
25293,25293,then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and
25294,25294,she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles
25295,25295,"im not such a fool just you try it on allezvous
promener she used to say often seeing the success she had with"
25296,25296,young and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did not
25297,25297,love her
25298,25298,"""you clear out of this"""
25299,25299,"yes i never loved her said he to himself ""i knew she was a"
25300,25300,now theres dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and
25301,25301,troubles he digested his sufferings alone
25302,25302,"it is all all her fault he said to himself ""but what of that"
25303,25303,apart from myself
25304,25304,i love you
25305,25305,martyrs death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a
25306,25306,despot who is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alive

25308,25308,"comparison with eternity"""
25309,25309,but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such
25310,25310,felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move
25311,25311,"about and break and tear whatever came to his hand ""why did i tell"
25312,25312,"her that je vous aime"" he kept repeating to himself and when he"
25313,25313,laugh at himself
25314,25314,in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
25315,25315,petersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he
25316,25316,resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
25317,25317,intention to part from her forever
25318,25318,pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand
25319,25319,he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled
25320,25320,"the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at
home said the valet"
25321,25321,countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with
25322,25322,silver and with simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round
25323,25323,except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent
25324,25324,marble brow with her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in
25325,25325,front of the valet she knew of the duel and had come to speak about
25326,25326,it she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and
25327,25327,like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and
25328,25328,he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down but looked at
25329,25329,"well whats this now what have you been up to now i should
like to know she asked sternly"
25330,25330,i what have i stammered pierre
25331,25331,"so it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel
about what is it meant to prove what i ask you"
25332,25332,but could not reply
25333,25333,"if you wont answer ill tell you helene went on ""you believe"
25334,25334,that what will be the result that i shall be the laughingstock of
25335,25335,"man whos a better man than you in every way"""
25336,25336,and not moving a muscle
25337,25337,"and how could you believe he was my lover why because i like
his company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should
prefer yours"
25338,25338,dont speak to me i beg you muttered pierre hoarsely
25339,25339,"why shouldnt i speak i can speak as i like and i tell you
plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who
would not have taken lovers des amants but i have not done so"
25340,25340,said she
25341,25341,chest and he could not breathe he knew that he must do something to
25342,25342,terrible
25343,25343,we had better separate he muttered in a broken voice
25344,25344,separate very well but only if you give me a fortune said
25345,25345,"helene ""separate thats a thing to frighten me with"""
25346,25346,pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her
25347,25347,brandishing the slab
25348,25348,fathers nature showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination and
25349,25349,terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror god knows
25350,25350,what he would have done at that moment had helene not fled from the
25351,25351,room
25352,25352,a week later pierre gave his wife full power to control all his

25355,25355,two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz
25356,25356,body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what
25357,25357,was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a
25358,25358,possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the
25359,25359,gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at
25360,25360,brilliant engagements the russians had had to retreat and had made
25361,25361,their withdrawal in perfect order the old prince understood from this
25362,25362,official report that our army had been defeated a week after the
25363,25363,gazette report of the battle of austerlitz came a letter from
25364,25364,kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son
25365,25365,father and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the
25366,25366,whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort
25367,25367,he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field
25368,25368,when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at
25369,25369,throwing down his chisel the wheel continued to revolve by its own
25370,25370,incomprehensiblethe death of one she loved
25371,25371,an indescribable charm of sorrow and selfforgetfulness that her
25372,25372,father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob
25373,25373,"bad news hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed
kutuzov writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to"
25374,25374,"drive the princess away by that scream ""killed"""
25375,25375,on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in
25376,25376,from the joys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief
25377,25377,neck
25378,25378,the princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father
25379,25379,and wept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he
25380,25380,"him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon ""did"

25384,25384,"go go killed in battle where the best of russian men and
russias glory were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell
lise i will follow"
25385,25385,calm peculiar to pregnant women it was evident that her eyes did
25386,25386,not see princess mary but were looking within into herself at
25387,25387,something joyful and mysterious taking place within her
25388,25388,held it below her waist
25389,25389,lifted in childlike happiness
25390,25390,princess mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of
25391,25391,her sisterinlaws dress
25392,25392,bright and happy eyes at her sisterinlaw
25393,25393,what is the matter mary

25395,25395,several times in the course of the morning princess mary began
25396,25396,looked about uneasily as if in search of something before dinner
25397,25397,a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without
25398,25398,while with that expression of attention to something within her that
25399,25399,has anything come from andrew she asked
25400,25400,"no you know its too soon for news but my father is anxious and i
feel afraid"

25452,25452,everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that
25453,25453,princess mary experienced as she sat in her room but owing to the

25561,25561,brought many young men to his parents house vera was a handsome girl
25562,25562,of twenty sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening
25563,25563,at that time in the rostovs house there prevailed an amorous
25564,25564,atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
25565,25565,charming girls every young man who came to the houseseeing those
25566,25566,fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly
25567,25567,prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of hope
25568,25568,experienced the same feeling sharing with the young folk of the
25569,25569,rostovs household a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of
25570,25570,happiness
25571,25571,among the young men introduced by rostov one of the first was
25572,25572,almost quarreled with her brother about him she insisted that he
25573,25573,unnatural
25574,25574,theres nothing for me to understand cried out with resolute
25575,25575,understand i dont know how to put it with this one everything
25576,25576,"even denisov was nothing compared to dolokhov""you must understand"
25577,25577,"mother what a heart"""
25578,25578,"well i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and
do you know he has fallen in love with sonya"
25579,25579,what nonsense
25580,25580,im certain of it youll see
25581,25581,question for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon
25582,25582,dolokhov appeared
25583,25583,which the rostovs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sonya
25584,25584,and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
25585,25585,blushed when they saw his looks
25586,25586,he did not explain to himself what these new relations were
25587,25587,theyre always in love with someone he thought of sonya and
25588,25588,natasha but he was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as
25589,25589,before and was less frequently at home
25590,25590,in the autumn of  everybody had again begun talking of the war
25591,25591,with napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders
25592,25592,militia everywhere bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow
25593,25593,nothing but the coming war was talked of for the rostov family the
25594,25594,whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that
25595,25595,termination of denisovs furlough after christmas to return with him
25596,25596,to their regiment his approaching departure did not prevent his
25597,25597,balls
25598,25598,chapter xi
25599,25599,and denisov were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany
25600,25600,atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs house as at
25601,25601,denisov
25602,25602,at the rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashas knight
25603,25603,im even weady to dance the pas de chale
25604,25604,"if i have time answered nicholas ""but i promised the"
25605,25605,"arkharovs they have a party"""
25606,25606,question he noticed that it should not have been put
25607,25607,pierre at the club dinner
25608,25608,confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left
25609,25609,immediately after dinner he called natasha and asked her what was the
25610,25610,matter
25611,25611,"and i was looking for you said natasha running out to him ""i"
25612,25612,"has proposed to sonya"""
25613,25613,something seemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a
25614,25614,orphan girl from the point of view of the old countess and of society
25615,25615,it was out of the question for her to refuse him and therefore
25616,25616,nicholas first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with
25617,25617,yes my sonya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas
25618,25618,"much as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont change
once she has said"
25619,25619,and mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfully
25620,25620,"for certain that you wont marry her"""
25621,25621,"now dont know that at all said nicholas ""but i must talk to"
25622,25622,"her what a darling sonya is"" he added with a smile"
25623,25623,ah she is indeed a darling ill send her to you
25624,25624,and natasha kissed her brother and ran away
25625,25625,look nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the
25626,25626,first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their
25627,25627,love
25628,25628,sonya interrupted him
25629,25629,i have already refused she said hurriedly
25630,25630,if you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that i
25631,25631,nicholas dont tell me that she said
25632,25632,"no but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to
say it if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole
truth i love you and i think i love you more than anyone else"
25633,25633,difficulty
25634,25634,"dont say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother and
always shall and i want nothing more"
25635,25635,"you are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of
misleading you"

25638,25638,iogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers
25639,25639,as they watched their young people executing their newly learned
25640,25640,women who came to these balls with an air of condescension and found
25641,25641,them most enjoyable that year two marriages had come of these
25642,25642,balls the two pretty young princesses gorchakov met suitors there and
25643,25643,were married and so further increased the fame of these dances what
25644,25644,distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess
25645,25645,collected the tickets from all his visitors there was the fact that
25646,25646,only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of
25647,25647,thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first
25648,25648,prettyso rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes
25649,25649,great success there were many pretty girls and the rostov girls
25650,25650,were among the prettiest they were both particularly happy and gay
25651,25651,transparently radiant with impulsive joy
25652,25652,natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
25653,25653,ball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with
25654,25654,pink ribbons
25655,25655,natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom she
25656,25656,person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment
25657,25657,patronage at the dancers
25658,25658,how sweet she isshe will be a weal beauty said denisov
25659,25659,who
25660,25660,countess natasha answered denisov
25661,25661,and how she dances what gwace he said again after a pause
25662,25662,who are you talking about
25663,25663,about your sister ejaculated denisov testily
25664,25664,rostov smiled
25665,25665,my dear count you were one of my best pupilsyou must dance
25666,25666,"said little iogel coming up to nicholas ""look how many charming young"
25667,25667,"ladies"" he turned with the same request to denisov who was also a"
25668,25668,former pupil of his
25669,25669,"no my dear fellow ill be a wallflower said denisov ""dont you"
25670,25670,"wecollect what bad use i made of your lessons"""
25671,25671, the band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could not
25672,25672,refuse iogel and asked sonya to dance denisov sat down by the old
25673,25673,denisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber
25674,25674,in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was
25675,25675,because he would not and not because he could not in the middle of
25676,25676,a figure he beckoned to rostov who was passing
25677,25677,"this is not at all the thing he said ""what sort of polish"
25678,25678,"mazuwka is this but she does dance splendidly"""
25679,25679,knowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the
25680,25680,natasha
25681,25681,go and choose denisov he is a real dancer a wonder he said
25682,25682,timidly to the corner where denisov sat she saw that everybody was
25683,25683,looking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denisov was refusing
25684,25684,though he smiled delightedly he ran up to them
25685,25685,oh no let me off countess denisov replied
25686,25686,now then vaska said nicholas
25687,25687,they coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokingly
25688,25688,ill sing for you a whole evening said natasha
25689,25689,waiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka was
25690,25690,denisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow
25691,25691,he felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked
25692,25692,round the room taking his partner with him he glided silently on
25693,25693,so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through
25694,25694,suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when
25695,25695,smiling as if she did not recognize him
25696,25696,what does this mean she brought out
25697,25697,leave her for the rest of the evening
25698,25698,chapter xiii
25699,25699,for two days after that rostov did not see dolokhov at his own or at
25700,25700,dolokhovs home on the third day he received a note from him
25701,25701,as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
25702,25702,supper tonight to my friendscome to the english hotel
25703,25703,about ten oclock rostov went to the english hotel straight from the
25704,25704,some twenty men were gathered round a table at which dolokhov sat
25705,25705,between two candles on the table was a pile of gold and paper
25706,25706,his proposal and sonyas refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought
25707,25707,of how they would meet
25708,25708,"its a long time since we met he said ""thanks for coming ill"
25709,25709,dolokhov made no reply
25710,25710,you may punt he said
25711,25711,rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once
25712,25712,guessing rostovs thought
25713,25713,beneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the
25714,25714,with which to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought
25715,25715,deliberately so that everyone could hear
25716,25716,"do you remember we had a talk about cards hes a fool who
trusts to luck one should make certain and i want to try"
25717,25717,to try his luck or the certainty rostov asked himself
25718,25718,moving the money forward he prepared to deal rostov sat down by his
25719,25719,side and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at him
25720,25720,why dont you play he asked
25721,25721,and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up
25722,25722,i have no money with me he said
25723,25723,ill trust you
25724,25724,"place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoning"""
25725,25725,one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted
25726,25726,"yes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i
ask you to put the money on your cards replied dolokhov ""dont"
25727,25727,the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to
25728,25728,his usual stake of twenty rubles
25729,25729,"but win from you or are you afraid of me"" he asked again"
25730,25730,rostov submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a
25731,25731,floor he well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the
25732,25732, rubles in clear upright figures he emptied the glass of warm
25733,25733,hands which held the pack much depended on rostovs winning or losing
25734,25734,on that seven of hearts on the previous sunday the old count had
25735,25735,speaking of money difficulties had told nicholas that this was all
25736,25736,this time nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough
25737,25737,for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more
25738,25738,till the spring now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that
25739,25739,plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery that could
25740,25740,pipe that were handed him
25741,25741,"yes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscow
that im a sharper so i advise you to be careful"
25742,25742,come now deal exclaimed rostov
25743,25743,cards with a smile
25744,25744,aah rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the
25745,25745,had lost more than he could pay
25746,25746,still dont ruin yourself said dolokhov with a side glance at
25747,25747,rostov as he continued to deal
25748,25748,chapter xiv
25749,25749,an hour and a half later most of the players were but little
25750,25750,interested in their own play
25751,25751,the whole interest was concentrated on rostov instead of sixteen
25752,25752,already exceeded twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no longer
25753,25753,rostovs hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against
25754,25754,him he had decided to play until that score reached fortythree
25755,25755,thousand he had fixed on that number because fortythree was the
25756,25756,not leave him that those broadboned reddish hands with hairy
25757,25757,"six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backs
impossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double or
quits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostov"
25758,25758,and at one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at
25759,25759,now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and
25760,25760,dolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind
25761,25761,terrible misfortune and when did it begin such a little while ago
25762,25762,i came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to
25763,25763,buy that casket for mammas name day and then going home i was so
25764,25764,begin what marked the change i sat all the time in this same place
25765,25765,agile hands in the same way when did it happen and what has happened
25766,25766,"it cant be surely it will all end in nothing"""
25767,25767,helpless efforts to seem calm
25768,25768,the score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree
25769,25769,which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his
25770,25770,supper its time for supper and here are the gypsies
25771,25771,some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold
25772,25772,outside and saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas
25773,25773,understood that it was all over but he said in an indifferent tone
25774,25774,well wont you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it
25775,25775,were the fun of the game which interested him most
25776,25776,"its all up im lost thought he ""now a bullet through my brain"
25777,25777,"thats all thats left me"" and at the same time he said in a"
25778,25778,cheerful voice
25779,25779,come now just this one more little card
25780,25780,moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy
25781,25781,"himself he rose from the table ""one does get tired sitting so"
25782,25782,i cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he said
25783,25783,oh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power

25785,25785,cat does with a mouse
25786,25786,him
25787,25787,"my cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to
mention her he exclaimed fiercely"
25788,25788,then when am i to have it
25789,25789,tomorrow replied rostov and left the room
25790,25790,chapter xv
25791,25791,confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word
25792,25792,poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the rostov household that
25793,25793,to have grown thicker round sonya and natasha as the air does before a

25811,25811,nicholas began pacing up and down the room
25812,25812,"why do they want to make her sing how can she sing theres
nothing to be happy about thought he"
25813,25813,sonya struck the first chord of the prelude

25829,25829,"opened eyes ""what has happened to her how she is singing today"" and"
25830,25830,suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the
25831,25831,"i really take it how fortunate"" he thought"
25832,25832,finest in rostovs soul and this something was apart from
25833,25833,everything else in the world and above everything in the world
25834,25834,"what were losses and dolokhov and words of honor all
nonsense one might kill and rob and yet be happy"

26384,26384,all else

26391,26391,since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote
26392,26392,me what i have seen during these last three months is incredible

26394,26394,on being polite to the french and lay down their arms at the first

26398,26398,and triumph
26399,26399,eaten up i myself will remain in hospital at ostrolenka till i
26400,26400,information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another
26401,26401,fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring
26402,26402,isnt it logical
26403,26403,"this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining after the field marshals departure it
appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle
buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen
does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who
are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the
opportunity to fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he
does so this is the battle of pultusk which is considered a great
victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as
you know have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won
or lost those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say
and according to that it is we who lost the battle of pultusk in
short we retreat after the battle but send a courier to petersburg
with news of a victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive
from petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his
victory does not give up the command of the army to general
buxhowden during this interregnum we begin a very original and
interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer as it should
be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid general
buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief so
energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an
unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our
enemy who at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general
buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy
force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to
escape him buxhowden pursues uswe scuttle he hardly crosses the
river to our side before we recross to the other at last our enemy
buxhowden catches us and attacks both generals are angry and the
result is a challenge on buxhowdens part and an epileptic fit on
bennigsens but at the critical moment the courier who carried the
news of our victory at pultusk to petersburg returns bringing our
appointment as commander in chief and our first foe buxhowden is
vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but
as it turns out just at that moment a third enemy rises before us
namely the orthodox russian soldiers loudly demanding bread meat
biscuits fodder and whatnot the stores are empty the roads
impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way of which our last
campaign can give you no idea half the regiments form bands and scour
the countryside and put everything to fire and sword the
inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick
and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack our
headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to
disperse them during one of these attacks they carried off my empty
portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give all
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much
fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other"
26404,26404,in spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
26405,26405,out there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his
26406,26406,he thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized
26407,26407,with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he
26408,26408,was reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and
26409,26409,opened it
26410,26410,just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from
26411,26411,him with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the
26412,26412,cot
26413,26413,my dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
26414,26414,him
26415,26415,seized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child
26416,26416,was dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror
26417,26417,it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the
26418,26418,not find the baby at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about
26419,26419,was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly
26420,26420,soft forehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand
26421,26421,gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed
26422,26422,under the blanket he heard a rustle behind him and a shadow
26423,26423,still gazing at the infants face listened to his regular breathing
26424,26424,her prince andrew recognized her without looking and held out his
26425,26425,hand to her she pressed it
26426,26426,he has perspired said prince andrew
26427,26427,i was coming to tell you so
26428,26428,forehead against the pillow
26429,26429,prince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain
26430,26430,her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy
26431,26431,slightly catching the curtain of the cot each made the other a
26432,26432,warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain
26433,26433,as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut
26434,26434,ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain
26435,26435,yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh
26436,26436,chapter x
26437,26437,taking with him full directions which he had written down for his
26438,26438,own guidance as to what he should do on his estates
26439,26439,when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
26440,26440,and explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that
26441,26441,steps would be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then
26442,26442,estates some of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among
26443,26443,young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of
26444,26444,could best handle the master for their own ends
26445,26445,but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go
26446,26446,into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory
26447,26447,an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a
26448,26448,an allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the
26449,26449,following budget
26450,26450,borrow besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of
26451,26451,and workshops so the first task pierre had to face was one for
26452,26452,which he had very little aptitude or inclinationpractical business
26453,26453,he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but he
26454,26454,felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that these
26455,26455,consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
26456,26456,necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities
26457,26457,which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the
26458,26458,emancipation
26459,26459,of which operations according to him were connected with such
26460,26460,replied
26461,26461,yes yes do so
26462,26462,pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled
26463,26463,him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only
26464,26464,tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the
26465,26465,steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he
26466,26466,considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and
26467,26467,troublesome to himself
26468,26468,the largest landowner of the province temptations to pierres
26469,26469,greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted
26470,26470,to the lodgewere so strong that he could not resist them again
26471,26471,instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old
26472,26472,of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not
26473,26473,fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of
26474,26474,and the love of death he consoled himself with the thought that he
26475,26475,fulfilled another of the preceptsthat of reforming the human race
26476,26476,generosity
26477,26477,in the spring of  he decided to return to petersburg on the way
26478,26478,he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his
26479,26479,orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom
26480,26480,god had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit
26481,26481,serfsmade some concessions continuing to represent the liberation
26482,26482,before the master arrived everywhere preparations were made not for
26483,26483,pierre the estates he had not before visited were each more
26484,26484,picturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and
26485,26485,touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere
26486,26486,joyful feeling in the depth of his heart in one place the peasants
26487,26487,presented him with bread and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint
26488,26488,another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him
26489,26489,religion on all his estates pierre saw with his own eyes brick
26490,26490,thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue coats
26491,26491,what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
26492,26492,with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter
26493,26493,and paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters
26494,26494,that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know
26495,26495,that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his
26496,26496,that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by
26497,26497,him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments
26498,26498,lessened on paper he did not know that where the steward had shown
26499,26499,him in the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by
26500,26500,half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and
26501,26501,quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
26502,26502,as he called the grand master
26503,26503,how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good
26504,26504,receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
26505,26505,through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with
26506,26506,pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above
26507,26507,was
26508,26508,pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
26509,26509,that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all
26510,26510,measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to
26511,26511,and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing
26512,26512,empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all
26513,26513,got out of them
26514,26514,chapter xi
26515,26515,returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest
26516,26516,bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among
26517,26517,house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and
26518,26518,with banks still bare of grass it was at the end of a village that
26519,26519,stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which
26520,26520,were a few fir trees
26521,26521,still in course of construction round the house was a garden newly
26522,26522,laid out the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps
26523,26523,an impress of tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre
26524,26524,anteroom
26525,26525,pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house
26526,26526,after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend
26527,26527,in petersburg
26528,26528,he quickly entered the small reception room with its
26529,26529,a visitor answered anton
26530,26530,ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed
26531,26531,back
26532,26532,pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
26533,26533,embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
26534,26534,and looked at him closely
26535,26535,well i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew
26536,26536,pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with
26537,26537,surprise he was struck by the change in him his words were kindly
26538,26538,lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give
26539,26539,till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow
26540,26540,indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought
26541,26541,as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged
26542,26542,anything they put questions and gave brief replies about things
26543,26543,they knew ought to be talked over at length at last the
26544,26544,conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first
26545,26545,despondency which pierre had noticed in his friends look was now
26546,26546,still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to
26547,26547,or the future it was as if prince andrew would have liked to
26548,26548,been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour he
26549,26549,desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a
26550,26550,"i cant tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardly
know myself again"
26551,26551,yes we have altered much very much since then said prince
26552,26552,andrew
26553,26553,well and you what are your plans
26554,26554,"to settle here altogether next year"""
26555,26555,which had grown much older
26556,26556,interrupted him
26557,26557,"but why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your
travels and all you have been doing on your estates"
26558,26558,far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had
26559,26559,been made prince andrew several times prompted pierres story of what
26560,26560,listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what
26561,26561,pierre was telling him
26562,26562,pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company
26563,26563,and at last became silent
26564,26564,am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am
26565,26565,going back to my sister today i will introduce you to her but of
26566,26566,"dinner and would you now like to look round my place"""
26567,26567,political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know
26568,26568,each other intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and
26569,26569,interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its
26570,26570,himself
26571,26571,"however this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and
then well set off"
26572,26572,i was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrew
26573,26573,"hurriedly ""i will tell you some time how it all happened but you"
26574,26574,"forever said prince andrew ""nothings forever"""
26575,26575,but you know how it all ended dont you you heard of the duel
26576,26576,and so you had to go through that too
26577,26577,one thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said
26578,26578,pierre
26579,26579,"why so asked prince andrew ""to kill a vicious dog is a very good"
26580,26580,"thing really"""
26581,26581,no to kill a man is badwrong
26582,26582,"why is it wrong urged prince andrew ""it is not given to man to"
26583,26583,know what is right and what is wrong men always did and always will
26584,26584,pleasure that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was
26585,26585,him to his present state
26586,26586,and who has told you what is bad for another man he asked
26587,26587,"bad bad exclaimed pierre ""we all know what is bad for"
26588,26588,"ourselves"""
26589,26589,more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new
26590,26590,"outlook to pierre he spoke in french ""i only know two very real"
26591,26591,evils in life remorse and illness the only good is the absence of
26592,26592,those evils to live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole

26597,26597,yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found
26598,26598,happiness when you began living for others i experienced just the

26618,26618,you grudged losing a laborerthats how i regard himbut you want to
26619,26619,prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that
26620,26620,spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long
26621,26621,time his glance became more animated as his conclusions became more
26622,26622,hopeless
26623,26623,"oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre ""i dont understand"
26624,26624,how one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long

sit without moving undertaking nothing"
26631,26631,"life as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do
nothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me
the honor to choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to

qualifications for itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness
necessary for the position then theres this house which must be
built in order to have a nook of ones own in which to be quiet and
now theres this recruiting"

26640,26640,and why do you serve
26641,26641,"why for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men
of his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he
has too energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited
power that he is terrible and now he has this authority of a

been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters

26648,26648,prince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered
26649,26649,feverishly while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there
26650,26650,was no desire to do good to his neighbor
26651,26651,"there now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued ""that is"
26652,26652,anyone flogged or sent to siberiaand still less for your serfs if

26655,26655,prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking
26656,26656,that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his
26657,26657,fathers case
26658,26658,he did not reply
26659,26659,"so thats what im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity
and not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you
may always remain the same backs and foreheads"

26662,26662,chapter xii
26663,26663,in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and
26664,26664,silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good
26665,26665,temper
26666,26666,in his husbandry
26667,26667,apparently immersed in his own thoughts
26668,26668,of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred
26669,26669,"you should not think so"""
26670,26670,think what about asked prince andrew with surprise
26671,26671,"about life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thought
like that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont
smile freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it
was freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal
aspects of humanity"
26672,26672,and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince
26673,26673,andrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed
26674,26674,outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree

well you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of
life the destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who
are we men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see
what you see you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i
dont see it"
26678,26678,pierre interrupted him
26679,26679,do you believe in a future life he asked
26680,26680,he knew prince andrews former atheistic convictions
26681,26681,"you say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor
could i and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the
end of everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to"
26682,26682,who are now the children of earth areeternallychildren of the
26683,26683,whole universe dont i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast

26686,26686,"and suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to
exist why it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe
there is thats what convinces that is what has convinced me"
26687,26687,said prince andrew
26688,26688,"no all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with
someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere
and you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have
looked in"
26689,26689,"well thats it then you know that there is a there and there is a
someone there is the future life the someone isgod"
26690,26690,prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long
26691,26691,sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was
26692,26692,the raft and talked
26693,26693,prince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening
26694,26694,the sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness
26695,26695,pierre became silent the raft had long since stopped and only the
26696,26696,waves of the current beat softly against it below prince andrew

26698,26698,it is true believe it

26722,26722,it was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the

sorrows he keeps it all within him today he is cheerful and in
good spirits but that is the effect of your visithe is not often
like that if you could persuade him to go abroad he needs
activity and this quiet regular life is very bad for him others

26784,26784,account and during the two days of the young mans visit he was
26785,26785,extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again
26786,26786,when pierre had gone and the members of the household met

26820,26820,but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with
26821,26821,it was a noxious plant that spring a new disease broke
26822,26822,which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite of
26823,26823,mashkas sweet root because it was the second week that the last of
26824,26824,the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man
26825,26825,and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen
26826,26826,the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the

26830,26830,quoits and skittles the general trend of the campaign was rarely
26831,26831,because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly
26832,26832,had become more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovs
26833,26833,rostov felt that the elder hussars luckless love for natasha played a
26834,26834,part in strengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to
26835,26835,greeted his safe return with evident joy on one of his foraging
26836,26836,would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty polish
26837,26837,said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all denisov
26838,26838,who did not himself know what rostovs relations with the polish
26839,26839,rostov replied
26840,26840,"say what you like she is like a sister to me and i cant
tell you how it offended me because well for that reason"
26841,26841,denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
26842,26842,noticed tears in his eyes
26843,26843,chapter xvi
26844,26844,but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at
26845,26845,place
26846,26846,they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth
26847,26847,steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the
26848,26848,this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed
26849,26849,that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit
26850,26850,the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the
26851,26851,"steps in the ""reception room""as denisov called that part of the hut"
26852,26852,head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being
26853,26853,wanted a talk
26854,26854,suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the
26855,26855,i ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuff denisov
26856,26856,"was shouting ""and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some"
26857,26857,"fwom the fields"""
26858,26858,"i have given the order again and again your honor but they
dont obey answered the quartermaster"
26859,26859,"rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently ""let"
26860,26860,he had gone out for provisions
26861,26861,then denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away
26862,26862,saddle second platoon
26863,26863,where are they off to now thought rostov
26864,26864,vaguely and crossly that he had some business
26865,26865,let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov
26866,26866,through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had
26867,26867,leave the hut till toward evening denisov had not yet returned the
26868,26868,buried themselves in the soft mud rostov joined them in the middle
26869,26869,hussars on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the
26870,26870,hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars
26871,26871,surrounded them
26872,26872,"the provisions"""
26873,26873,"so they are said the officers ""wont the soldiers be glad"""
26874,26874,infantry officers with whom he was talking
26875,26875,rostov went to meet them
26876,26876,havent i told you i wont give them up replied denisov
26877,26877,"you will answer for it captain it is mutinyseizing the
transport of ones own army our men have had nothing to eat for two
days"
26878,26878,and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov
26879,26879,it is robbery youll answer for it sir said the infantry
26880,26880,"buzz about here till you get hurt be off go"" he shouted at the"
26881,26881,officers
26882,26882,go to the devil quick mach while youre safe and sound and
26883,26883,denisov turned his horse on the officer
26884,26884,a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov
26885,26885,after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
26886,26886,ive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said
26887,26887,after all cant let our men starve
26888,26888,the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
26889,26889,them with the other squadrons
26890,26890,holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said
26891,26891,"this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and
wont begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff
and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if
possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not
as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a
row and the affair may end badly"
26892,26892,staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he
26893,26893,came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen
26894,26894,him in denisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov
26895,26895,"twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but
ill always thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewo
ice he muttered"
26896,26896,necessary to bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken
26897,26897,from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had
26898,26898,happened to him
26899,26899,quarters they were pointed out please to wait ive widden
26900,26900,twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait
26901,26901,who takes them to fill his own pockets will you please be
26902,26902,silent vewy good then he says go and give a weceipt to the
26903,26903,hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently
26904,26904,that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped
26905,26905,"about ""telyanin what so its you whos starving us to death is"
26906,26906,"killed him if they hadnt taken him away"""
26907,26907,"but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov ""youve"
26908,26908,denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke
26909,26909,calm and cheerful
26910,26910,but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostovs and
26911,26911,denisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully
26912,26912,showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental
26913,26913,commander in which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence
26914,26914,the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad
26915,26915,degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for
26916,26916,of one of them
26917,26917,that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed
26918,26918,dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not
26919,26919,easily forget
26920,26920,him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart
26921,26921,to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
26922,26922,the staff of his division to explain his violence at the
26923,26923,commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two
26924,26924,bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of
26925,26925,his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the
26926,26926,excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital
26927,26927,chapter xvii
26928,26928,news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and
26929,26929,leave to visit denisov in hospital
26930,26930,the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice
26931,26931,soldiers wandering about
26932,26932,the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window
26933,26933,frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a
26934,26934,wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged
26935,26935,the sunshine in the yard
26936,26936,directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
26937,26937,putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army
26938,26938,doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian
26939,26939,assistant
26940,26940,"i cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying ""come to"
26941,26941,"makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there"""
26942,26942,the assistant asked some further questions
26943,26943,oh do the best you can isnt it all the same the doctor noticed
26944,26944,rostov coming upstairs
26945,26945,"what do you want sir said the doctor ""what do you want the"
26946,26946,how so asked rostov

26948,26948,who was wounded
26949,26949,"i dont know i cant tell you sir only think i am alone in
charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients its
well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of
coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed"
26950,26950,the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and
26951,26951,impatient for the talkative doctor to go
26952,26952,"major denisov rostov said again ""he was wounded at molliten"""
26953,26953,indifference
26954,26954,is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor
26955,26955,rostov described denisovs appearance
26956,26956,"makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant ""but if"
26957,26957,"stay here yourself"""
26958,26958,but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the
26959,26959,assistant to show him the way
26960,26960,only dont blame me the doctor shouted up after him
26961,26961,rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell
26962,26962,was so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and
26963,26963,collect his strength before he could go on a door opened to the
26964,26964,with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing glancing in at
26965,26965,on straw and overcoats
26966,26966,may i go in and look
26967,26967,what is there to see said the assistant
26968,26968,it originated
26969,26969,unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers those who were
26970,26970,the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining
26971,26971,out like cords he was knocking the back of his head against the
26972,26972,his place and bring him water
26973,26973,who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant
26974,26974,evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities
26975,26975,pointing to the cossack

26977,26977,fixed on rostov the mans neighbor on one side whispered something to
26978,26978,speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg
26979,26979,his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled
26980,26980,back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his

26993,26993,showed itself in the expression of denisovs face and the
26994,26994,intonations of his voice
26995,26995,weeks after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as
26996,26996,struck rostov what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to
26997,26997,spoke of these matters did not listen
26998,26998,rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of
26999,26999,outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was
27000,27000,only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on
27001,27001,from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission
27002,27002,and the rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he
27003,27003,began reading his paper and specially drew rostovs attention to the
27004,27004,who had gathered round rostova fresh arrival from the world outside
27005,27005,gradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his
27006,27006,answer rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
27007,27007,already heard that story more than once and were tired of it only the

27020,27020,hasty temper
27021,27021,stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening
27022,27022,denisov whether he had no commission for him

27032,27032,he was being tested
27033,27033,i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the
27034,27034,boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two

27038,27038,since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it
27039,27039,his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note
27040,27040,it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of

27042,27042,did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out the
27043,27043,interview had lasted an hour and fiftythree minutes he noted this
27044,27044,people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had
27045,27045,surprised had he been absent
27046,27046,officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and

27050,27050,from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and
27051,27051,the frenchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat
27052,27052,between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov
27053,27053,was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers
27054,27054,from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank
27055,27055,the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the
27056,27056,threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there
27057,27057,him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face
27058,27058,on first recognizing rostov
27059,27059,coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first
27060,27060,impulse
27061,27061,"ive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have
business he said coldly"
27062,27062,him
27063,27063,"""in a minute i shall be at your disposal"""
27064,27064,i see im intruding rostov repeated
27065,27065,the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face
27066,27066,seemed to rostov
27067,27067,and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
27068,27068,zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very
27069,27069,willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did not
27070,27070,same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with
27071,27071,had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor
27072,27072,rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look
27073,27073,alone took no part in the conversation which again became general the
27074,27074,"looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say ""and what is he"
27075,27075,"sitting here for"" he rose and went up to boris"
27076,27076,"anyhow im in your way he said in a low tone ""come and talk"
27077,27077,"over my business and ill go away"""
27078,27078,"lie down in my room and have a rest"""
27079,27079,yes really

27081,27081,leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender
27082,27082,into rostovs eyes with the same veiled look each time this
27083,27083,happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes
27084,27084,"i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe
in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the
emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in
general i think"
27085,27085,so you dont want to do anything well then say so rostov almost
27086,27086,boris smiled
27087,27087,on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought

27100,27100,and bunting were displayed
27101,27101,here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not
27102,27102,without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is
27103,27103,where alexander lodged
27104,27104,saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
27105,27105,"i may see him at any moment thought rostov ""if only i were to"
27106,27106,hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really
27107,27107,arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand
27108,27108,in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for

27117,27117,a petition this way to the officer on duty he was
27118,27118,was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so
27119,27119,fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run
27120,27120,rostov entered
27121,27121,speaking to someone in the adjoining room
27122,27122,what is it a petition
27123,27123,what is it asked the person in the other room

27137,27137,making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
27138,27138,familiar voice called him and a hand detained him
27139,27139,what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep
27140,27140,voice
27141,27141,it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special

27173,27173,approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came

27192,27192,and the small white hand holding the order touched one of lazarevs
27193,27193,buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his
27194,27194,hand to deign to touch that soldiers breast for the soldier to be
27195,27195,cross would adhere there and it really did
27196,27196,and fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little

27219,27219,why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he
27220,27220,thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned he

27374,27374,began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army
27375,27375,regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness
27376,27376,prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception
27377,27377,in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the
27378,27378,because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of
27379,27379,halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss
27380,27380,of his wife besides this the general opinion of all who had known him
27381,27381,previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five

27401,27401,speranskis whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily
27402,27402,recognizable in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never
27403,27403,seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed
27404,27404,such calmness and selfassurance he had never seen so resolute yet

27406,27406,and talked with napoleon

27408,27408,people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no

27410,27410,prince andrew followed speranskis every word and movement with
27411,27411,expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities
27412,27412,speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come

everyone has he said after a pause"

27424,27424,extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the
27425,27425,old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from an
27426,27426,speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
27427,27427,disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign
27428,27428,rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of
27429,27429,the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest
27430,27430,himself in bolkonski
27431,27431,"i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said"

our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely
reestablishes natural justice"
27441,27441,i think however that these condemnations have some ground
27442,27442,which he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in
27443,27443,everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke
27444,27444,while talking with speranski he was too much absorbed in observing
27445,27445,the famous mans personality
27446,27446,grounds of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietly
27447,27447,and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew

similar to the legion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not
harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class

27460,27460,"i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court
privileges have attained the same end returned prince andrew ""every"

27465,27465,chapter vi
27466,27466,during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew
27467,27467,felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of
27468,27468,seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed
27469,27469,him in that city
27470,27470,on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook
27471,27471,four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the
27472,27472,he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the
27473,27473,same remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy
27474,27474,for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was
27475,27475,thinking of nothing
27476,27476,he received him teteatate at his own house and talked to him long
27477,27477,and confidentially
27478,27478,to bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and
27479,27479,readily believed that in speranski he had found this ideal of a
27480,27480,perfectly rational and virtuous man had speranski sprung from the
27481,27481,same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and
27482,27482,mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite
27483,27483,others capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to
27484,27484,prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes
27485,27485,hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumption
27486,27486,that ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
27487,27487,understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the
27488,27488,reasonableness and profundity of ones own ideas
27489,27489,"more than once remarked ""we regard everything that is above the"
27490,27490,"wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe"" or ""they cannot"
27491,27491,this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in
27492,27492,prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first
27493,27493,which he was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince
27494,27494,andrews eyes speranski was the man he would himself have wished to
27495,27495,standard of reason to everything everything seemed so simple and
27496,27496,clear in speranskis exposition that prince andrew involuntarily
27497,27497,only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit
27498,27498,to speranskis opinions entirely everything was right and
27499,27499,everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince
27500,27500,which prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the
27501,27501,hands of those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those
27502,27502,used to support his opinions he made use of every kind of mental
27503,27503,suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics this last resource was one
27504,27504,he very frequently employed he would transfer a question to
27505,27505,descend to the level of the original discussion
27506,27506,in general the trait of speranskis mentality which struck prince
27507,27507,andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and
27508,27508,authority of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur
27509,27509,after all impossible to express all one thinks and that he had
27510,27510,it was just this peculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly
27511,27511,attracted prince andrew
27512,27512,during the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a
27513,27513,passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt
27514,27514,for bonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village
27515,27515,strengthen it
27516,27516,sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and
27517,27517,rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the
27518,27518,different codes
27519,27519,and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent
27520,27520,"serve in these times"""
27521,27521,prince andrew said that for that work an education in
27522,27522,jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess
27523,27523,"but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious
circle from which we must break a way out"
27524,27524,a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army
27525,27525,regulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of a
27526,27526,section of the committee for the revision of the laws at

27530,27530,petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found
27531,27531,himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he
27532,27532,and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic
27533,27533,charters he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented
27534,27534,majority of members were stingy and irregular he supported almost
27535,27535,singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg
27536,27536,considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations
27537,27537,of the bachelor circles in which he moved
27538,27538,at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to
27539,27539,him at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under
27540,27540,him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had
27541,27541,joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who
27542,27542,confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his
27543,27543,joseph alexeevich was not in petersburghe had of late stood
27544,27544,entirely in moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew
27545,27545,whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under
27546,27546,the masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at
27547,27547,reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in
27548,27548,which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul
27549,27549,he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first
27550,27550,he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the
27551,27551,mystical science of the order with questions of the threefold
27552,27552,and saltor the meaning of the square and all the various figures
27553,27553,of the temple of solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to
27554,27554,heart was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry
27555,27555,in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like
27556,27556,in the third category he included those brothers the majority
27557,27557,who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and
27558,27558,troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and
27559,27559,even the grand master of the principal lodge
27560,27560,particularly those who had lately joined these according to
27561,27561,with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their
27562,27562,pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing
27563,27563,based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry
27564,27564,and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of
27565,27565,the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the
27566,27566,order
27567,27567,in the summer of  pierre returned to petersburg our
27568,27568,freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that bezukhov
27569,27569,and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the
27570,27570,advantage of the masonic cause in russia the petersburg freemasons
27571,27571,seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and
27572,27572,concealing it
27573,27573,at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers
27574,27574,what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their
27575,27575,order the meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre
27576,27576,rose and began his address
27577,27577,"but we must act"" pierre raised his notebook and began to read"
27578,27578,unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power
27579,27579,"to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over
vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this
world receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great
endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of
today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor
revolutions overthrow everything repel force by force no we are
very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it
quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also
because wisdom needs no violence

the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of"
27580,27580,preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of
27581,27581,patronizing talent and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and
27582,27582,attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the
27583,27583,power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder
27584,27584,be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of
27585,27585,their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great
27586,27586,this aim was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and

27591,27591,meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of
27592,27592,identically to two persons even those members who seemed to be on his
27593,27593,side understood him in their own way with limitations and
27594,27594,to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it
27595,27595,the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical
27596,27596,institutions
27597,27597,at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and illwill
27598,27598,reproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
27599,27599,pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would

27602,27602,again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for
27603,27603,three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a
27604,27604,sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere

27606,27606,at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she
27607,27607,would return to petersburg from abroad
27608,27608,following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre
27609,27609,of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his
27610,27610,wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of
27611,27611,freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent
27612,27612,him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a
27613,27613,most important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy
27614,27614,nothing mattered to him nothing in life seemed to him of much
27615,27615,him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his
27616,27616,wife
27617,27617,"no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to
blame he thought"
27618,27618,it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to
27619,27619,indifference whether he lived with his wife or not
27620,27620,late one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see
27621,27621,joseph alexeevich this is what he noted in his diary
27622,27622,what i have experienced joseph alexeevich is living poorly and has
27623,27623,for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the
27624,27624,bladder no one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of
27625,27625,and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay i made the sign of
27626,27626,the prussian and scottish lodges i told him everything as best i
27627,27627,me my whole past and the future path i should follow he surprised
27628,27628,me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the order
27629,27629, the preservation and study of the mystery  the purification
27630,27630,improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which
27631,27631,is the principal aim of these three certainly selfreformation and
27632,27632,selfpurification only to this aim can we always strive independently
27633,27633,of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the
27634,27634,human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
27635,27635,attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground
27636,27636,the depth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs
27637,27637,lies in perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the
27638,27638,that we can attain our three chief aims  selfknowledgefor man
27639,27639,virtuelove of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its
27640,27640,vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new
27641,27641,loftiness of his inner manhe does not yet feel himself
27642,27642,sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully the
27643,27643,meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out to me that the
27644,27644,numbers three and seven are the basis of everything he advised me not
27645,27645,selfknowledge and selfperfecting besides this he advised me for
27646,27646,i will in future note down all my actions
27647,27647,i am again living with my wife my motherinlaw came to me in tears
27648,27648,and said that helene was here and that she implored me to hear her
27649,27649,knew that if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to
27650,27650,go on refusing what she wanted in my perplexity i did not know
27651,27651,whose aid and advice to seek had my benefactor been here he would
27652,27652,have told me what to do i went to my room and reread joseph
27653,27653,ought to reach a helping hand to everyoneespecially to one so
27654,27654,closely bound to meand that i must bear my cross but if i forgive
27655,27655,nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she need not know
27656,27656,how hard it was for me to see her again i have settled on the upper
27657,27657,floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of

27674,27674,conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment
27675,27675,but whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a
27676,27676,reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established
27677,27677,that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody
27678,27678,would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound
27679,27679,meaning in it of which she herself had no conception

27727,27727,caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i
27728,27728,vainly tried to overcome that is why i should really like to save him
27729,27729,him did not leave me it seemed to me that his object in entering
27730,27730,the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of
27731,27731,our lodge apart from the fact that he had asked me several times
27732,27732,whether n and s were members of our lodge a question to which i
27733,27733,could not reply and that according to my observation he is
27734,27734,incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied

27749,27749,meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter
27750,27750,replies i recollected myself and drove away that thought only when
27751,27751,repent afterwards boris drubetskoy came and began relating various

27765,27765,seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened we
27766,27766,saying i began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and
27767,27767,was glad he noticed this but he looked at me with vexation and jumped

27816,27816,he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was
27817,27817,his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of
27818,27818,letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between
27819,27819,himself and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he
27820,27820,had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with
27821,27821,the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he
27822,27822,realized when he entered the rostovs drawing room natasha was in her
27823,27823,own room when she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the
27824,27824,known her four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a
27825,27825,astonishment this expression on his face pleased natasha
27826,27826,well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the
27827,27827,countess

27833,27833,felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
27834,27834,at her occasionally
27835,27835,all comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at
27836,27836,arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his
27837,27837,compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg

27842,27842,and spending whole days at the rostovs it seemed to him that he
27843,27843,ought to have an explanation with natasha and tell her that the old
27844,27844,marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on
27845,27845,such an explanation from day to day he became more and more
27846,27846,entangled it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in

27857,27857,hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased

27859,27859,daughter
27860,27860,what is it tonightbut i have to tell you
27861,27861,natasha put her hand on her mothers mouth

boris is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what
then what are you thinking about you have quite turned his
head i can see that"

27865,27865,natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the
27866,27866,countess only saw her daughters face in profile that face struck her
27867,27867,by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression
27868,27868,natasha was listening and considering

27870,27870,"you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him
you know you cant marry him"
27871,27871,"because he is young because he is poor because he is a
relation and because you yourself dont love him"

27878,27878,natasha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to
27879,27879,daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she
27880,27880,had wished to say
27881,27881,"it wont do my love not everyone will understand this

27987,27987,once had time to think of what lay before her
27988,27988,she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her
27989,27989,petersburg the prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it
27990,27990,and closeness of the carriage she understood all that awaited her
27991,27991,and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable
27992,27992,and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all
27993,27993,her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that became

28000,28000,gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
28001,28001,irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball the
28002,28002,host also followed natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was

28005,28005,the emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front
28006,28006,rows of that crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were
28007,28007,asking about her and looking at her she realized that those
28008,28008,there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought
28009,28009,peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important
28010,28010,people at the ball
28011,28011,that is the dutch ambassador do you see that grayhaired man
28012,28012,said

28017,28017,plain daughter
28018,28018,"she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya ""and"
28019,28019,a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head

28033,28033,reception over the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on
28034,28034,several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again

28040,28040,polonaise natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and
28041,28041,having been invited to dance she stood with her slender arms
28042,28042,was not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people
28043,28043,"whom peronskaya was pointing outshe had but one thought ""is it"
28044,28044,dance is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me

28046,28046,she wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the
28047,28047,other end of the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by
28048,28048,themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of
28049,28049,the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and
28050,28050,looked at natasha as one looks at a wall boris passed them twice

28054,28054,own green dress
28055,28055,at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced
28056,28056,with three and the music ceased a worried aidedecamp ran up to the

28063,28063,the front row of the circle not far from the rostovs baron firhoff
28064,28064,was talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state

remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite"

28079,28079,she raised her hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the
28080,28080,second couple to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best
28081,28081,dancers of his day and natasha danced exquisitely her little feet
28082,28082,happiness her slender bare arms and neck were not beautifulcompared
28083,28083,to helenes her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but
28084,28084,had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary
28085,28085,possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
28086,28086,chosen natasha because pierre pointed her out to him and because she
28087,28087,was the first pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he
28088,28088,embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close
28089,28089,to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to
28090,28090,leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers
28091,28091,chapter xvii
28092,28092,noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did
28093,28093,she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french
28094,28094,that helene had great success and was honored was by the special

28096,28096,departure for one of the merry cotillions before supper prince andrew
28097,28097,was again her partner he reminded her of their first encounter in the
28098,28098,there had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew had
28099,28099,overheard
28100,28100,meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp and
28101,28101,even her mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special
28102,28102,and most unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the
28103,28103,chose her she was tired and panting and evidently thought of

28106,28106,room to choose two ladies for the figure
28107,28107,"if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she
will be my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own"
28108,28108,beside him
28109,28109,when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up
28110,28110,asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not
28111,28111,answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said
28112,28112,"reproachfully ""how can you ask such a question"""
28113,28113,andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
28114,28114,father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had
28115,28115,ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one
28116,28116,becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the
28117,28117,at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the
28118,28118,position his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and
28119,28119,by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one
28120,28120,on her way to supper natasha passed him
28121,28121,her own happiness
28122,28122,"how delightful it is count said she ""isnt it"""
28123,28123,yes i am very glad he said
28124,28124,how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha
28125,28125,especially such a capital fellow as bezukhov in natashas eyes
28126,28126,loving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand so
28127,28127,they ought all to be happy
28128,28128,chapter xviii
28129,28129,he set to work
28130,28130,but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was illdisposed for
28131,28131,those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to
28132,28132,partisans hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into
28133,28133,prince andrews room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking
28134,28134,he had just heard particulars of that mornings sitting of the council
28135,28135,the emperors speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such
28136,28136,"as only constitutional monarchs deliver ""the sovereign plainly said"
28137,28137,government must rest not on authority but on secure bases the emperor
28138,28138,said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts
28139,28139,matter to me or to bitski what the emperor was pleased to say at the
28140,28140,"council can all that make me any happier or better"""
28141,28141,and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest
28142,28142,prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to
28143,28143,"business"" and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh"
28144,28144,speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared
28145,28145,mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and
28146,28146,unattractive
28147,28147,at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed
28148,28148,to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before
28149,28149,magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate
28150,28150,this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely
28151,28151,accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good
28152,28152,humored ridicule speranski related how at the council that morning
28153,28153,broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the
28154,28154,abuses that existed under the former order of thingsthreatening to
28155,28155,give a serious turn to the conversation magnitski starting quizzing
28156,28156,the talk reverted to its former lively tone
28157,28157,evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find
28158,28158,seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome speranskis
28159,28159,grated on him like a false note prince andrew did not laugh and
28160,28160,one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood
28161,28161,they all seemed very gay
28162,28162,remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the
28163,28163,thing existed
28164,28164,after dinner speranskis daughter and her governess rose he
28165,28165,patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that
28166,28166,the men remained at table over their portenglish fashion in the
28167,28167,midst of a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish
28168,28168,story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few
28169,28169,moments all were silent
28170,28170,immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses
28171,28171,in french which he had composed about various wellknown petersburg
28172,28172,people he was interrupted several times by applause when the
28173,28173,verses were finished prince andrew went up to speranski and took his
28174,28174,leave
28175,28175,where are you off to so early asked speranski
28176,28176,i promised to go to a reception
28177,28177,they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those
28178,28178,him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of his own
28179,28179,in prince andrews ears long after he had left the house
28180,28180,when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in

28309,28309,it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince

28311,28311,man she had then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and
28312,28312,"and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg
while we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that
ball it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this

28320,28320,telling him of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her

28322,28322,that day countess helene had a reception at her house the french
28323,28323,morose air
28324,28324,since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous
28325,28325,depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the
28326,28326,thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than
28327,28327,before at the same time the feeling he had noticed between his
28328,28328,protegee natasha and prince andrew accentuated his gloom by the
28329,28329,contrast between his own position and his friends he tried equally
28330,28330,and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with
28331,28331,eternity again the question for what presented itself and he

28336,28336,smiled at him with the egotism of joy
28337,28337,yesterday and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything
28338,28338,suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person
28339,28339,down on the sofa beside prince andrew

28351,28351,apart from and independent of himself
28352,28352,"i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of
such love said prince andrew ""it is not at all the same feeling"

29369,29369,when they came out onto the beaten highroadpolished by sleigh
29370,29370,visible in the moonlightthe horses began to tug at the reins of
29371,29371,horses driven by zakhar could be clearly seen against the white

29373,29373,side and flourishing the whip
29374,29374,it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given

29387,29387,horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh
29388,29388,beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused
29389,29389,glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they
29390,29390,were passing the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the
29391,29391,voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides
29392,29392,still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled
29393,29393,with stars
29394,29394,"zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the
left thought nicholas ""are we getting to the melyukovs is this"

glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver
roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and

turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really"
29531,29531,seen what she described
29532,29532,well and then sonya
29533,29533,"after that i could not make out what there was something blue and
red"

29539,29539,vexation and left the room the old count began irresolutely to
29540,29540,admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose nicholas replied
29541,29541,conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family
29542,29542,was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had
29543,29543,his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the
29544,29544,family finances
29545,29545,the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son
29546,29546,catch nicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with
29547,29547,was required of her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her
29548,29548,benefactors selfsacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this
29549,29549,neither could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his
29550,29550,happiness depended on that love she was silent and sad and did not
29551,29551,reply nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to
29552,29552,have an explanation with his mother he first implored her to
29553,29553,threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry her
29554,29554,secretly
29555,29555,would never receive that intriguer as her daughter
29556,29556,his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his

29668,29668,moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to
29669,29669,that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last
29670,29670,chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or
29671,29671,never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile

29688,29688,blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that
29689,29689,tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his
29690,29690,everincreasing intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at
29691,29691,the first moment of receiving the news of his sons intentions had
29692,29692,occurred to him in jestthat if andrew got married he himself would

29697,29697,affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few
29698,29698,minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess marys room

29700,29700,"house go dont let me set eyes on you beg her pardon"""
29701,29701,for her intervention
29702,29702,at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in
29703,29703,her soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look
29704,29704,a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had

29716,29716,that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods
29717,29717,he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with
29718,29718,everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not
29719,29719,to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet
29720,29720,and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and
29721,29721,loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion until the doctors
29722,29722,princess mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door
29723,29723,through which she could hear all that passed in the study
29724,29724,to force the guard
29725,29725,of his eyes rolled downwards
29726,29726,who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room
29727,29727,"the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head
keep calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his"
29728,29728,fingers to his lips he hastened away
29729,29729,through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry
29730,29730,"spies traitors traitors everywhere not a moments peace in my
own house"
29731,29731,and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a
29732,29732,"he returned and trying to appear calm added ""and dont imagine i have"
29733,29733,it will be carried outwe must part so find some place for
29734,29734,"yourself"" but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence"
29735,29735,he shook his fists at her and screamed
29736,29736,at two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner
29737,29737,the younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoyawaited the prince
29738,29738,in the drawing room
29739,29739,contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his
29740,29740,case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his
29741,29741,house
29742,29742,the princes house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
29743,29743,townwas one it was more flattering to be received in than any other
29744,29744,boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in
29745,29745,rostopchin had replied that he could not come
29746,29746,"on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince
nicholas bolkonski"
29747,29747,"oh yes yes replied the commander in chief ""how is he"""
29748,29748,the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty
29749,29749,oldfashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn
29750,29750,gathering of a court of justice all were silent or talked in low
29751,29751,tones prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary
29752,29752,seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were
29753,29753,gossip
29754,29754,lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the
29755,29755,conversation prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge
29756,29756,showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the
29757,29757,tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of
29758,29758,what was being done in the political world incidents were related
29759,29759,evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to
29760,29760,criticism might touch the sovereign himself
29761,29761,at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleons
29762,29762,bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said
29763,29763,"before ""one only wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the"

29766,29766,silent our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the

29768,29768,impossible
29769,29769,"other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of
oldenburg said prince bolkonski ""he shifts the dukes about as i"

29772,29772,respectfully
29773,29773,he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the
29774,29774,honor of being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at
29775,29775,"i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was
surprised how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in"
29776,29776,the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him
29777,29777,understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the
29778,29778,note
29779,29779,"long as its substance is forcible"""
29780,29780,"my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should
be easy to have a good style returned count rostopchin"
29781,29781,pierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording
29782,29782,of the note

29786,29786,"whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing"""
29787,29787,and he laughed unnaturally
29788,29788,there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general
29789,29789,cleared his throat to draw attention
29790,29790,"did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the
figure cut by the new french ambassador"
29791,29791,"eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his
majestys presence"
29792,29792,took no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no
29793,29793,attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply

one looks at our young people prince one would like to take peter

russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them"
29802,29802,all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile
29803,29803,and wagged his head approvingly
29804,29804,getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to
29805,29805,the prince
29806,29806,offering his cheek to be kissed
29807,29807,following rostopchins example the others also rose

29817,29817,"oh yes she answered ""you noticed nothing"" her look asked"
29818,29818,pierre was in an agreeable afterdinner mood he looked straight

29870,29870,future sisterinlaw as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to
29871,29871,accustom the old prince to her

29878,29878,not merely as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive she
29879,29879,was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a
29880,29880,very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew
29881,29881,any obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years before of
29882,29882,boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a
29883,29883,sexless acquaintance
29884,29884,that winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and
29885,29885,hospitable in moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner
29886,29886,supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning julie never
29887,29887,the latest fashion but in spite of that she seemed to be
29888,29888,disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not
29889,29889,"and expected peace only ""yonder"" she adopted the tone of one who"

29896,29896,rustic trees your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me

29902,29902,there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she
29903,29903,in reply boris wrote these lines

29918,29918,nizhegorod estates
29919,29919,julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy
29920,29920,adorer and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of
29921,29921,of real love still restrained boris his leave was expiring he
29922,29922,thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose
29923,29923,continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural
29924,29924,though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of

29934,29934,their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them
29935,29935,julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs
29936,29936,at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have
29937,29937,wasted his effortswhich was a thing he never allowed to happen
29938,29938,said
29939,29939,i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary
29940,29940,he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability

29953,29953,was impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in
29954,29954,future daughterinlaw to old prince bolkonski while he was in

29962,29962,new book read to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception
29963,29963,persons in the town
29964,29964,she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the
29965,29965,pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the
29966,29966,have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately

29975,29975,"tomorrow whom will you send for shinshin"" she crooked one of her"

29982,29982,put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now without
29983,29983,"some new fashion and what have you to do yourself"" she asked"
29984,29984,the count sternly
29985,29985,"one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a
purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if
you will be so kind ill fix a time and go down to the estate just
for a day and leave my lassies with you"
29986,29986,next morning marya dmitrievna took the young ladies to the iberian
29987,29987,afraid of marya dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at
29988,29988,a loss merely to get rid of her marya dmitrievna ordered almost the
29989,29989,whole trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the
29990,29990,"well now well talk i congratulate you on your betrothed
youve hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and ive known
him since he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the"

29992,29992,listen you know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his sons
29993,29993,marrying the old fellows crotchety of course prince andrew is not a

29995,29995,"your wits then all will be well"""
29996,29996,really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her
29997,29997,affairs that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince
29998,29998,take her she wanted nothing more
29999,29999,"you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your

30000,30000,yes it will natasha answered reluctantly
30001,30001,chapter vii
30002,30002,call on prince nicholas bolkonski the count did not set out
30003,30003,remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the
30004,30004,had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his
30005,30005,fatherand of herfor being his sisterthat there is no reason
30006,30006,"for them not to like me"""
30007,30007,they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and
30008,30008,entered the vestibule
30009,30009,half in earnest but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on
30010,30010,entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the
30011,30011,prince and princess were at home
30012,30012,when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
30013,30013,servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
30014,30014,another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a
30015,30015,princess begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the
30016,30016,visitors was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and
30017,30017,daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess
30018,30018,trying to appear cordial and at ease from the first glance princess
30019,30019,frivolously gay and vain she did not at all realize that before
30020,30020,having seen her future sisterinlaw she was prejudiced against her by
30021,30021,jealousy of her brothers love for her apart from this insuperable
30022,30022,they were not to be admitted to him she had decided to receive
30023,30023,there my dear princess ive brought you my songstress said
30024,30024,"prince might appear ""i am so glad you should get to know one"
30025,30025,"and then ill come back for her"""
30026,30026,the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told
30027,30027,his daughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk
30028,30028,and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of
30029,30029,departed
30030,30030,despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess marywho
30031,30031,wished to have a teteatete with natashamademoiselle bourienne
30032,30032,remained in the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements
30033,30033,and theaters natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had
30034,30034,unnatural manner of the princess whoshe thoughtwas making a
30035,30035,dry natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an
30036,30036,offhand air which alienated princess mary still more after five
30037,30037,of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary looked
30038,30038,frightened
30039,30039,"stressing the word ""god"" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that"
30040,30040,princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at
30041,30041,her father or at natasha
30042,30042,mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably
30043,30043,head to foot he went out
30044,30044,mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
30045,30045,apparition and began speaking about the princes indisposition
30046,30046,grew their antipathy to one another
30047,30047,could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
30048,30048,"hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew ""i couldnt begin"
30049,30049,natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why
30050,30050,"glad my brother has found happiness"""
30051,30051,noticed this and guessed its reason
30052,30052,i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now
30053,30053,choking her
30054,30054,was out of the room
30055,30055,they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day
30056,30056,"natasha what is it about she asked ""what do they matter to you"
30057,30057,but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i
30058,30058,"dont talk about it natasha it wasnt your fault so why should
you mind kiss me said sonya"
30059,30059,her wet face against her
30060,30060,i cant tell you i dont know no ones to blame said natasha
30061,30061,"its my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why doesnt he

30062,30062,upset natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the
30063,30063,count and the other guests

30065,30065,dmitrievna had taken a box
30066,30066,dmitrievnas kind offer which was intended expressly for her when she
30067,30067,"o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but
differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply
embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those
searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me
and then i would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyeshow
i see those eyes thought natasha ""and what do his father and sister"

30069,30069,"different i cant"""
30070,30070,natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
30071,30071,of love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside
30072,30072,first row of boxes through the closed doors the music was already
30073,30073,audible
30074,30074,natasha your hair whispered sonya
30075,30075,an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
30076,30076,opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the
30077,30077,door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
30078,30078,before their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of
30079,30079,feminine envy at natasha the curtain had not yet risen and the
30080,30080,a sensation she had not experienced for a long timethat of
30081,30081,hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and necksuddenly

30101,30101,box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which
30102,30102,natasha knew so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly

30122,30122,just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the
30123,30123,conductor tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in
30124,30124,attention with eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look
30125,30125,at it

30128,30128,in red bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk
30129,30129,green cardboard was glued they all sang something when they had
30130,30130,finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompters box

30134,30134,bowing
30135,30135,all this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow
30136,30136,the opera nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted
30137,30137,and sang so strangely in that brilliant light she knew what it was
30138,30138,unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused
30139,30139,"expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned ""i suppose it has"
30140,30140,"to be like this"" she thought she kept looking round in turn at the"
30141,30141,rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women

30144,30144,experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she
30145,30145,the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through
30146,30146,her mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box
30147,30147,to lean over to helene and tickle her

30152,30152,she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was
30153,30153,now in an adjutants uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot
30154,30154,he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous
30155,30155,had he not been so goodlooking and had his handsome face not worn
30156,30156,such an expression of goodhumored complacency and gaiety though

30171,30171,in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her
30172,30172,during the whole of that entracte kuragin stood with dolokhov in
30173,30173,knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even
30174,30174,turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its
30175,30175,most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre
30176,30176,appeared in the stalls the rostovs had not seen him since their
30177,30177,and indicating the rostovs box on seeing natasha pierre grew
30178,30178,mans voice in countess bezukhovas box and something told her it
30179,30179,straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that
30180,30180,notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black
30181,30181,cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands they began

30184,30184,metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a
30185,30185,prayer all these things were repeatedly interrupted by the
30186,30186,enthusiastic shouts of the audience
30187,30187,during this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she
30188,30188,staring at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her

30203,30203,and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet
30204,30204,stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men
30205,30205,and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the

30213,30213,and told her he had long wished to have this happinessever since the
30214,30214,pleasure of seeing her kuragin was much more sensible and simple with

30216,30216,goodnatured
30217,30217,kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
30218,30218,previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage

30223,30223,barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other
30224,30224,men she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come
30225,30225,to feel herself terribly near to this man when she turned away she
30226,30226,feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her
30227,30227,they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man
30228,30228,during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles
30229,30229,question and blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she
30230,30230,was doing something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage

30822,30822,importance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed pierre
30823,30823,had been avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling
30824,30824,for her was stronger than a married mans should be for his friends
30825,30825,fiancee yet some fate constantly threw them together
30826,30826,what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he
30827,30827,"as he dressed to go to marya dmitrievnas ""if only prince andrew"

30830,30830,on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him
30831,30831,pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head
30832,30832,in a sleigh drawn by two gray trottinghorses that were bespattering

30837,30837,in marya dmitrievnas anteroom the footman who helped him off with
30838,30838,his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom
30839,30839,when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the

30841,30841,"lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful"""
30842,30842,marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew
30843,30843,without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was
30844,30844,anatole kuragin into whose society pierres wife had thrown her and
30845,30845,order to be married secretly
30846,30846,pierre raised his shoulders and listened openmouthed to what was

30848,30848,used to be so charmingshould give up bolkonski for that fool anatole
30849,30849,could not conceive and could not imagine
30850,30850,unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied
30851,30851,prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded
30852,30852,contempt and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him
30853,30853,in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that
30854,30854,and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an
30855,30855,expression of calm dignity and severity

him since yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go on
expecting him"
30859,30859,dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that
30860,30860,of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge
30861,30861,brotherinlaw in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set

30926,30926,"you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to
elope with her is that so"

is such a thing as other peoples happiness and peace and that you
are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse
yourself with women like my wifewith them you are within your
rights for they know what you want of them they are armed against
you by the same experience of debauchery but to promise a maid to
marry her to deceive to kidnap dont you understand that it is
as mean as beating an old man or a child"

30981,30981,him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost
30982,30982,the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering
30983,30983,the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated
30984,30984,voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old princes

31115,31115,caused by englands intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st
31116,31116,helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that
31117,31117,the cause of the war was napoleons ambition to the duke of
31118,31118,to businessmen that the cause of the way was the continental system
31119,31119,which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the
31120,31120,chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them
31121,31121,employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of
31122,31122,time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
31123,31123,russia and austria in  had not been sufficiently well concealed
31124,31124,it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of
31125,31125,posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
31126,31126,insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of
31127,31127,christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon
31128,31128,astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what
31129,31129,connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter
31130,31130,from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolensk
31131,31131,and moscow and were killed by them
31132,31132,away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
31133,31133,present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes
31134,31134,the more of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of
31135,31135,causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by
31136,31136,impotenceapart from the cooperation of all the other coincident
31137,31137,that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as
31138,31138,napoleons refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to
31139,31139,the war could not have occurred
31140,31140,had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
31141,31141,have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a
31142,31142,second term then also there could have been no war nor could there
31143,31143,have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of
31144,31144,could have happened so all these causesmyriads of causescoincided
31145,31145,to bring it about and so there was no one cause for that
31146,31146,who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this
31147,31147,alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried
31148,31148,any one of which the event could not have taken place it was
31149,31149,necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power
31150,31150,have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and
31151,31151,complex causes
31152,31152,we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of
31153,31153,which we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in

31168,31168,by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and

31170,31170,the french emperors love and habit of war coinciding with his
31171,31171,and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining
31172,31172,and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to
31173,31173,the event that was happening or coincided with it
31174,31174,nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions
31175,31175,in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the
31176,31176,botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue
31177,31177,decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under
31178,31178,the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and
31179,31179,prayed for it equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon
31180,31180,weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for
31181,31181,the last time with his mattock in historic events the socalled great

31188,31188,diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and
31189,31189,and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always

31198,31198,looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out
31199,31199,of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown
31200,31200,an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of

31203,31203,of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the
31204,31204,longexpected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the
31205,31205,gray coat who was standing on the hill
31206,31206,was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one
31207,31207,and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because
31208,31208,it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of

31210,31210,that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across
31211,31211,polish uhlans stationed by the river
31212,31212,pressing against one another to see him
31213,31213,handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run
31214,31214,absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his head he
31215,31215,polish uhlans
31216,31216,what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans
31217,31217,when one of the aidesdecamp rode up to them
31218,31218,the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel

31221,31221,would not be displeased at this excess of zeal
31222,31222,for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans
31223,31223,galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in
31224,31224,they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some
31225,31225,clinging to their horses manes they tried to make their way

31228,31228,drowning uhlans who distracted his attention
31229,31229,for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
31230,31230,to dumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he called
31231,31231,for his horse and rode to his quarters
31232,31232,sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from
31233,31233,which they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and
31234,31234,with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they
31235,31235,vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been
31236,31236,but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves

31245,31245,the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor
31246,31246,had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the
31247,31247,vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even
31248,31248,increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each

31251,31251,tired of waitingprepare for the war all the efforts of those who
31252,31252,surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend

31254,31254,polish aidesdecamp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be
31255,31255,given for the emperor by his aidesdecamp this idea was eagerly

31257,31257,money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to
31258,31258,his aidesdecamp at bennigsens country house
31259,31259,it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters
31260,31260,declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one
31261,31261,place countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who
31262,31262,had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the
31263,31263,beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance
31264,31264,was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
31265,31265,patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of
31266,31266,his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen
31267,31267,enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only
31268,31268,to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not
31269,31269,another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter
31270,31270,and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to
31271,31271,slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to
31272,31272,speak before a look of amazement appeared on the emperors face he
31273,31273,unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both
31274,31274,sides made way for him boris noticed arakcheevs excited face when
31275,31275,the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the
31276,31276,forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him
31277,31277,boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased
31278,31278,that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than
31279,31279,through himself
31280,31280,but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated
31281,31281,he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and
31282,31282,how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he
31283,31283,close to the doorpost with bowed head
31284,31284,"to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as
long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to"
31285,31285,boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was
31286,31286,displeased that boris had overheard it
31287,31287,let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown
31288,31288,remained there about another halfhour
31289,31289,boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army
31290,31290,important personages that much that was concealed from others was
31291,31291,estimation
31292,31292,the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was
31293,31293,indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased
31294,31294,words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a
31295,31295,single armed frenchman remained on russian soil
31296,31296,next day the following letter was sent to napoleon
31297,31297,that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with
31298,31298,me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons
31299,31299,on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him

31302,31302,ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend

31309,31309,would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on
31310,31310,russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon
31311,31311,with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use
31312,31312,but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to

31354,31354,well general it all looks like war as if regretting a

31365,31365,then you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he
31366,31366,balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of
31367,31367,the war
31368,31368,that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as
31369,31369,good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters

31385,31385,which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with
31386,31386,sneered malevolently
31387,31387,when he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression
31388,31388,what he wanted
31389,31389,thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
31390,31390,davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor

31419,31419,balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russiawere waiting
31420,31420,duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before
31421,31421,going for his ride
31422,31422,to follow him
31423,31423,rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of
31424,31424,opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his
31425,31425,his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the
31426,31426,gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome
31427,31427,slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad
31428,31428,that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live
31429,31429,that day
31430,31430,up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of
31431,31431,his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but
31432,31432,is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well
31433,31433,"good day general said he ""i have received the letter you"
31434,31434,"brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you"" he"
31435,31435,glanced with his large eyes into balashavs face and immediately
31436,31436,looked past him
31437,31437,it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at
31438,31438,all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested
31439,31439,will
31440,31440,"been forced on me even now"" he emphasized the word ""i am ready to"
31441,31441,"receive any explanations you can give me"""
31442,31442,and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
31443,31443,dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly
31444,31444,was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter
31445,31445,into negotiations
31446,31446,sire the emperor my master but the sight of the emperors
31447,31447,"eyes bent on him confused him ""you are flurriedcompose yourself"""
31448,31448,at balashevs uniform and sword
31449,31449,balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the
31450,31450,emperor alexander did not consider kurakins demand for his
31451,31451,passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his
31452,31452,might proceed
31453,31453,into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated
31454,31454,he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his
31455,31455,told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these
31456,31456,"the french army retires beyond the niemen"""
31457,31457,napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these last
31458,31458,words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to
31459,31459,quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began
31460,31460,speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the
31461,31461,involuntarily noticed the quivering of napoleons left leg which
31462,31462,increased the more napoleon raised his voice
31463,31463,i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began
31464,31464,making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump
31465,31465,hand
31466,31466,the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied
31467,31467,balashev
31468,31468,"the niemen repeated napoleon ""so now you want me to retire"
31469,31469,straight at balashev
31470,31470,the latter bowed his head respectfully
31471,31471,instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from
31472,31472,napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room
31473,31473,"you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen
before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months
ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the
oder and yet you are willing to negotiate"
31474,31474,he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and
31475,31475,again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg
31476,31476,was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in
31477,31477,its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing
31478,31478,"napoleon was conscious of ""the vibration of my left calf is a great"
31479,31479,"quite to his own surprise ""if you gave me petersburg and moscow i"
31480,31480,could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but
31481,31481,offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with
31482,31482,longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its
31483,31483,alexanders errors and duplicity
31484,31484,the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
31485,31485,intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and
31486,31486,showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had
31487,31487,words
31488,31488,the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt
31489,31489,himself and insult alexanderjust what he had least desired at the
31490,31490,commencement of the interview
31491,31491,i hear you have made peace with turkey
31492,31492,balashev bowed his head affirmatively
31493,31493,peace has been concluded he began
31494,31494,but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all
31495,31495,eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so
31496,31496,prone
31497,31497,he wont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united
31498,31498,them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia
31499,31499,from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the
31500,31500,what a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have been
31501,31501,tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him
31502,31502,all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 
31503,31503,and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders
31504,31504,mind granted that were they competent they might be made use
31505,31505,passes bringing no result bagration alone is a military man hes
31506,31506,what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd
31507,31507,they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that
31508,31508,happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a
31509,31509,challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a
31510,31510,military commander
31511,31511,"the campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been
able to defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of
the polish provinces your army is grumbling"
31512,31512,remember what had been said to him and following these verbal
31513,31513,"i know everything napoleon interrupted him ""i know everything i"
31514,31514,know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you
31515,31515,i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the
31516,31516,vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing
31517,31517,and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedesit is
31518,31518,their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they
31519,31519,"swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad"""
31520,31520,napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his
31521,31521,nose
31522,31522,would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing
31523,31523,russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon
31524,31524,gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that
31525,31525,merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began
31526,31526,to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and
31527,31527,transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he
31528,31528,knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any
31529,31529,at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid
31530,31530,meeting his eyes
31531,31531,"but what do i care about your allies said napoleon ""i have"
31532,31532,alliesthe poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight
31533,31533,"like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them"""
31534,31534,and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered
31535,31535,shouted
31536,31536,will reerect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind
31537,31537,"you that is what you have gained by alienating me"" and he walked"
31538,31538,twitching
31539,31539,in a quiet voice
31540,31540,and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had
31541,31541,russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon
31542,31542,listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were
31543,31543,"yourself i have convinced you"""
31544,31544,handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought him a pocket
31545,31545,balashev
31546,31546,"that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very
highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer
general you shall receive my letter to the emperor"
31547,31547,and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception
31548,31548,room rushed forward and descended the staircase
31549,31549,chapter vii
31550,31550,after all that napoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and
31551,31551,true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are
31552,31552,"there in moscow"" he asked"
31553,31553,and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred
31554,31554,why such a quantity of churches
31555,31555,the russians are very devout replied balashev
31556,31556,caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark
31557,31557,balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor
31558,31558,every country has its own character said he
31559,31559,but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon
31560,31560,the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that
31561,31561,"they were puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested ""if there is a"
31562,31562,balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this
31563,31563,caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg
31564,31564,to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences
31565,31565,four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander
31566,31566,balashev to a chair beside him
31567,31567,consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was
31568,31568,balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence
31569,31569,"yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were
deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and"
31570,31570,that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal
31571,31571,enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may
31572,31572,which was still fresh in him
31573,31573,"out let him prepare an asylum for them in russia"""
31574,31574,balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
31575,31575,hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression
31576,31576,fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masters
31577,31577,humiliation
31578,31578,"and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what
is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to
reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a
responsibility"
31579,31579,to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the
31580,31580,greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court
31581,31581,"long way to go"""
31582,31582,the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to
31583,31583,alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the
31584,31584,chapter viii
31585,31585,anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching
31586,31586,petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the
31587,31587,city pierre had warned his brotherinlaw that prince andrew was on
31588,31588,his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the
31589,31589,minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in
31590,31590,prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge
31591,31591,kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause
31592,31592,it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to
31593,31593,meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel
31594,31594,his betrothed had broken faith with himwhich he felt the more
31595,31595,acutely the more he tried to conceal its effectsthe surroundings
31596,31596,independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only
31597,31597,could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he
31598,31598,lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later
31599,31599,recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had
31600,31600,revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters
31601,31601,eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if
31602,31602,the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs
31603,31603,surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not
31604,31604,contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince
31605,31605,himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with himhe knew
31606,31606,that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him
31607,31607,tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of
31608,31608,days and nights with a wallachian womanprince andrew asked kutuzov
31609,31609,readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly
31610,31610,and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the
31611,31611,same in every detail he entered through the gates with their stone
31612,31612,pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were
31613,31613,joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant
31614,31614,of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more
31615,31615,left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was
31616,31616,skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas
31617,31617,of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do
31618,31618,inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew
31619,31619,had seen them last the household was divided into two alien and
31620,31620,they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for
31621,31621,whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them
31622,31622,all feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first
31623,31623,morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner
31624,31624,the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of
31625,31625,that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince
31626,31626,nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter
31627,31627,daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he
31628,31628,opinion if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you
31629,31629,if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless
31630,31630,smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew
31631,31631,could not get accustomed
31632,31632,"what companion my dear boy eh youve already been talking it
over eh"
31633,31633,"blameis that frenchwoman"""
31634,31634,ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man
31635,31635,"off let not a trace of you remain here"""
31636,31636,not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne
31637,31637,into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this
31638,31638,sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or
31639,31639,regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms
31640,31640,to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former
31641,31641,tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the
31642,31642,boy and taking him on his knee
31643,31643,well go on said his son
31644,31644,out of the room
31645,31645,especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he
31646,31646,some work as soon as possible
31647,31647,so youve decided to go andrew asked his sister
31648,31648,"thank god that i can replied prince andrew ""i am very sorry"
31649,31649,"you cant"""
31650,31650,"why do you say that replied princess mary ""why do you say"
31651,31651,"mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you"""
31652,31652,tears began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the
31653,31653,room
31654,31654,"ah my god my god when one thinks who and whatwhat trashcan
cause people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess"
31655,31655,mary
31656,31656,"she understood that when speaking of ""trash"" he referred not only to"
31657,31657,who had ruined his own happiness
31658,31658,his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears
31659,31659,"i understand you she looked down ""dont imagine that sorrow is"
31660,31660,"the work of men men are his tools"" she looked a little above"
31661,31661,"one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs ""sorrow is"
31662,31662,have no right to punish and then you will know the happiness of
31663,31663,"forgiving"""
31664,31664,unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart
31665,31665,"if mary is already persuading me forgive it means that i ought
long ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no"
31666,31666,would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the army
31667,31667,knew how unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being
31668,31668,soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his
31669,31669,differences would become
31670,31670,"goodby andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men
are never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when"
31671,31671,he took leave of her
31672,31672,then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the
31673,31673,is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits
31674,31674,will deceive or be deceived and i am off to the army why i myself

31676,31676,another to prince andrews mind
31677,31677,chapter ix
31678,31678,prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the
31679,31679,to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be
31680,31680,cut off by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the

31684,31684,the emperor he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him
31685,31685,in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the emperor for a
31686,31686,andrew was glad to hear this his mind was occupied by the interests
31687,31687,be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of
31688,31688,form a definite opinion about it but the question whether the camp
31689,31689,was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided
31690,31690,already from his military experience and what he had seen in the
31691,31691,most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends
31692,31692,on the way unexpected movements of the enemythat cannot be foreseen
31693,31693,deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs
31694,31694,the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on him was the head
31695,31695,were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments
31696,31696,in rank the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich count
31697,31697,wolzogenand many others though these men had no military
31698,31698,did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice
31699,31699,emanated from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it
31700,31700,had to be executed or not but this was only the external condition
31701,31701,the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all
31702,31702,disposed of all the armies the men around him were his assistants
31703,31703,arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the
31704,31704,sovereigns bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna
31705,31705,hand to replace barclay the grand duke was there because it suited
31706,31706,him to be the exminister stein was there because his advice was
31707,31707,useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally
31708,31708,armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of
31709,31709,paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the
31710,31710,adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
31711,31711,thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a

31714,31714,a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their
31715,31715,ownthere were many secondary personages accompanying the army
31716,31716,because their principals were there
31717,31717,sharply defined subdivisions of and parties
31718,31718,the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherentsmilitary
31719,31719,theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable lawslaws
31720,31720,adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in
31721,31721,members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from
31722,31722,vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides
31723,31723,not let the army get discouraged
31724,31724,to the third partyin which the emperor had most confidence
31725,31725,belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the
31726,31726,convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said
31727,31727,plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel
31728,31728,then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the
31729,31729,of this third party
31730,31730,of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
31731,31731,gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had
31732,31732,narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had
31733,31733,both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they
31734,31734,will come of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall
31735,31735,abandon drissa the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude
31736,31736,this view was very general in the upper army circles and found
31737,31737,the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay

31740,31740,any rate there was no one more active and experienced than
31741,31741,arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse
31742,31742,"and an unbroken series of blunders ""the more mistakes that are made"
31743,31743,the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that
31744,31744,things cannot go on like this what is wanted is not some barclay or
31745,31745,whom napoleon himself did justicea man whose authority would be

31747,31747,were particularly many round alexandergenerals and imperial
31748,31748,adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce
31749,31749,pitch
31750,31750,and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of
31751,31751,conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors
31752,31752,other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post
31753,31753,would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who
31754,31754,wished to gain some advantage would attract the emperors attention by
31755,31755,loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day
31756,31756,proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good
31757,31757,knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him
31758,31758,a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come
31759,31759,on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for
31760,31760,this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct
31761,31761,so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere
31762,31762,and the diversity of race among these peoplethis eighth and
31763,31763,largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted
31764,31764,great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question
31765,31765,drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly
31766,31766,what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means
31767,31767,the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong
31768,31768,resulted chiefly from the emperors presence in the army with his
31769,31769,military court and from the consequent presence there of an
31770,31770,which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign
31771,31771,the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army
31772,31772,that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty
31773,31773,worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the
31774,31774,very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch

31777,31777,people of the capitalthat the emperor should leave the army

31779,31779,them to defend their countrythe very incitement which was the

31799,31799,whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending
31800,31800,council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally
31801,31801,minute to speak to chernyshev
31802,31802,typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german
31803,31803,theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united
31804,31804,to such an extent
31805,31805,was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been

31821,31821,absolute truth

31823,31823,oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the
31824,31824,warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarousmonstrous collisions in
31825,31825,which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars
31826,31826,therefore could not serve as material for science

31831,31831,practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his
31832,31832,theory
31833,31833,he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the
31834,31834,unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed
31835,31835,hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently

31859,31859,trap as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated

31875,31875,consider napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his
31876,31876,prince andrew from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him

31878,31878,brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he
31879,31879,evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
31880,31880,theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole
31881,31881,world was slipping away from him

32368,32368,there heres a patriot for you said shinshin

32392,32392,reduced him to this condition
32393,32393,no i think ill go home

simply i have business"
32400,32400,why no tell me natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped

32402,32402,silently kissed her hand and went out
32403,32403,pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs any more
32404,32404,chapter xxi
32405,32405,notice anything
32406,32406,rostovs domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him
32407,32407,that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
32408,32408,collar to look like a grownup man he frowned before his looking
32409,32409,the emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentlemaninwaiting
32410,32410,he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by

32412,32412,prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentlemaninwaiting
32413,32413,it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for
32414,32414,success in reaching the emperorhe even thought how surprised
32415,32415,everyone would be at his youthfulnessand yet in the arrangement of
32416,32416,his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to
32417,32417,appear a grownup man but the farther he went and the more his
32418,32418,attention was diverted by the everincreasing crowds moving toward the
32419,32419,deliberation of a man as he approached the kremlin he even began to
32420,32420,avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a
32421,32421,menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to
32422,32422,the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic
32423,32423,intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
32424,32424,"what are you shoving for young lordling dont you see were all
standing still then why push"
32425,32425,elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner
32426,32426,of the gateway
32427,32427,petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the
32428,32428,damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a
32429,32429,mans
32430,32430,he were now to approach the gentlemeninwaiting in that plight he
32431,32431,would not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten
32432,32432,would not be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed
32433,32433,kremlin square which was already full of people there were people not
32434,32434,soon as petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound
32435,32435,of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole
32436,32436,kremlin
32437,32437,hurrah hurrah hurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and
32438,32438,all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm
32439,32439,down her cheeks
32440,32440,with her fingers
32441,32441,hurrah was heard on all sides

32446,32446,backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a
32447,32447,strip of red cloth spread out on it but just then the crowd swayed
32448,32448,backthe police in front were pushing back those who had pressed

32450,32450,to the cathedral of the assumptionand petya unexpectedly received
32451,32451,such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that
32452,32452,suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost

32466,32466,be happy
32467,32467,while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumption

32518,32518,this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
32519,32519,merchantclassles etats generaux statesgeneralevoked in him a
32520,32520,whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply
32521,32521,graven in his soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french
32522,32522,revolution the words that had struck him in the emperors appeal
32523,32523,that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his
32524,32524,peoplestrengthened this idea and imagining that in this direction
32525,32525,finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him
32526,32526,moved about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of
32527,32527,by districts or by whole provinces and so on but as soon as the
32528,32528,talk became undecided and indefinite then all preferred listening
32529,32529,to speaking
32530,32530,crowd was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had
32531,32531,approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of
32532,32532,expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some
32533,32533,people pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away
32534,32534,disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him pierre pushed his
32535,32535,generally slurring his consonants the voice of a man calling out to
32536,32536,dissipation and the exercise of authority
32537,32537,"what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the

authority"
32545,32545,pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his
32546,32546,heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow
32547,32547,attitude into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped

33026,33026,reddishbrown mist heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the
33027,33027,unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up

33030,33030,sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep as soon as day dawned

33036,33036,and mouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to
33037,33037,the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud
33038,33038,abandonment made an epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger

33045,33045,expression on his face that the old man himself understood how
33046,33046,untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief
33047,33047,yes let them have it replied prince andrew

occupies the place asked prince andrew"

to the ryazan estate or to the one near moscow"

33064,33064,plums without being caughtand prince andrew shared their wish for
33065,33065,the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them
33066,33066,merrily and quickly across the meadow grass
33067,33067,prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the
33068,33068,dusty highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from
33069,33069,bald hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment
33070,33070,at its halting place by the dam of a small pond it was past one

33072,33072,motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops

33248,33248,was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
33249,33249,of timidity and submission on seeing his daughter he moved his
33250,33250,helpless lips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out
33251,33251,the very couch he had so feared of late

33283,33283,during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him
33284,33284,but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of
33285,33285,losing him she recalled all her life with him and in every word and

33408,33408,connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of
33409,33409,in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to
33410,33410,the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work

33437,33437,households at work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do

33444,33444,of those he dealt with having glanced at dron he at once understood
33445,33445,that his answers did not express his personal views but the general
33446,33446,camps the masters and the serfs he noticed this hesitation in
33447,33447,drons look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him

33498,33498,for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry
33499,33499,mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that

33501,33501,should sink into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself
33502,33502,but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her
33503,33503,voice
33504,33504,your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle

33513,33513,"said ""of course i would on no account wish to go away from him"

33520,33520,afford them proper protection she handed this to the princess
33521,33521,and and am sure that all due respect would be shown you

33542,33542,just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had
33543,33543,been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of
33544,33544,yes princess to all princess marys questions and hardly
33545,33545,refrained from sobbing as he looked at her
33546,33546,deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost
33547,33547,princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of
33548,33548,him
33549,33549,always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to

33553,33553,why shouldnt you go away your excellency you can go said dron

i can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i want to go

33555,33555,"dron paused he looked askance at princess mary and said ""there are"
33556,33556,"no horses i told yakov alpatych so"""
33557,33557,why are there none asked the princess
33558,33558,"its all gods scourge said dron ""what horses we had have been"

33561,33561,the peasants are ruined they have no bread she asked
33562,33562,"theyre dying of hunger said dron ""its not a case of carting"""
33563,33563,"but why didnt you tell me dronushka isnt it possible to help
them ill do all i can"
33564,33564,and the rich could refrain from helping the poor she had heard
33565,33565,"vaguely that there was such a thing as ""landlords corn"" which was"
33566,33566,sometimes given to the peasants she also knew that neither her father
33567,33567,feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of
33568,33568,the grain she wished to give she was glad such cares presented
33569,33569,she began asking dron about the peasants needs and what there was
33570,33570,in bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord
33571,33571,but we have grain belonging to my brother she said
33572,33572,"the landlords grain is all safe replied dron proudly ""our"

33574,33574,"give it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you
leave in my brothers name said she"
33575,33575,dron made no answer but sighed deeply
33576,33576,"give them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all
i give this order in my brothers name and tell them that what is
ours is theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so"
33577,33577,dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking
33578,33578,"discharge me little mother for gods sake order the keys to be
taken from me said he ""i have served twentythree years and have"
33579,33579,princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
33580,33580,asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his
33581,33581,devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
33582,33582,peasants
33583,33583,chapter xi
33584,33584,and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess
33585,33585,order and wished to have word with their mistress
33586,33586,"but i never told them to come said princess mary ""i only told"
33587,33587,"dron to let them have the grain"""
33588,33588,"yakov alpatych returns let us get away and please dont"""
33589,33589,what is a trick asked princess mary in surprise

say they dont agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered"
33591,33591,youre making some mistake i never ordered them to go away
33592,33592,"said princess mary ""call dronushka"""
33593,33593,dron came and confirmed dunyashas words the peasants had come by
33594,33594,the princess order
33595,33595,"but i never sent for them declared the princess ""you must have"
33596,33596,given my message wrong i only said that you were to give them the
33597,33597,"grain"""
33598,33598,dron only sighed in reply
33599,33599,if you order it they will go away said he
33600,33600,"they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to
remain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
french thought princess mary ""i will offer them monthly rations and"
33601,33601,housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in
33602,33602,and i shall grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because
33603,33603,it is dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving

33606,33606,the princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd
33607,33607,"brother and his son"""
33608,33608,again she paused no one broke the silence
33609,33609,all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she
33610,33610,apprehension and distrustbut the expression on all the faces was
33611,33611,identical
33612,33612,"we are all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us to
take the landlords grain said a voice at the back of the crowd"
33613,33613,but why not asked the princess
33614,33614,found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped
33615,33615,but why dont you want to take it she asked again
33616,33616,no one answered
33617,33617,the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
33618,33618,someones eye
33619,33619,why dont you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just
33620,33620,"in front of her leaning on his stick ""if you think something more"
33621,33621,"why should we give up everything we dont agree dont agree
we are sorry for you but were not willing go away yourself
alone came from various sides of the crowd"
33622,33622,and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical
33623,33623,but you cant have understood me said princess mary with a sad
33624,33624,"while here the enemy would ruin you"""
33625,33625,but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd
33626,33626,"were not willing let them ruin us we wont take your grain we
dont agree"
33627,33627,eye in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying
33628,33628,to avoid her look she felt strange and awkward
33629,33629,"oh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your
houses and go into bondage i dare say ill give you grain indeed
she says voices in the crowd were heard saying"
33630,33630,with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the
33631,33631,house having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for
33632,33632,with her own thoughts
33633,33633,chapter xii
33634,33634,for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of
33635,33635,her room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her
33636,33636,that she could not understand them however much she might think
33637,33637,the past now she could remember it and weep or pray
33638,33638,after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh
33639,33639,pictures of the near pasther fathers illness and last moments
33640,33640,rose one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now
33641,33641,even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night and
33642,33642,these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such
33643,33643,she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
33644,33644,eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her
33645,33645,even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died
33646,33646,"she thought ""he had always thought what he said then"" and she"
33647,33647,recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the
33648,33648,home against his will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs
33649,33649,that night had listened at the door in a suffering and weary voice he
33650,33650,"nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk ""and why"
33651,33651,"didnt he call me why didnt he let me be there instead of tikhon"""
33652,33652,"princess mary had thought and thought again now ""now he will never"
33653,33653,tell anyone what he had in his soul never will that moment return for
33654,33654,tikhon but i might have heard and understood him why didnt i enter
33655,33655,"the room"" she thought ""perhaps he would then have said to me what he"
33656,33656,said the day he died while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice
33657,33657,was sad and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand
33658,33658,him i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were
33659,33659,alivehe had forgotten she was deadand tikhon reminded him that she
33660,33660,behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly
33661,33661,done to me what could i have lost and perhaps he would then have
33662,33662,"been comforted and would have said that word to me"" and princess mary"
33663,33663,uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of
33664,33664,that relieved her soul she now saw his face before her and not the
33665,33665,face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen
33666,33666,stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said
33667,33667,dearest she repeated again
33668,33668,she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as
33669,33669,he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief
33670,33670,and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and
33671,33671,it held her fast
33672,33672,tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants
33673,33673,quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running
33674,33674,toward her

33677,33677,and went for a rideto try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find
33678,33678,out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages
33679,33679,for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile
33680,33680,before the french could get them
33681,33681,rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to
33682,33682,raced one another to try ilyins horse
33683,33683,rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property
33684,33684,of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister
33685,33685,rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the

33687,33687,stroking his heated donets horse
33688,33688,and id have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka
33689,33689,"mortify you"""
33690,33690,was standing
33691,33691,without doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled
33692,33692,officers
33693,33693,"fine fellows said rostov laughing ""is there any hay here"""
33694,33694,and how like one another said ilyin
33695,33695,a moost merry coompa sang one of the peasants with a
33696,33696,blissful smile
33697,33697,one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov
33698,33698,who do you belong to he asked
33699,33699,"himself""and he pointed to lavrushka"
33700,33700,then you are russians the peasant asked again
33701,33701,coming up
33702,33702,"very large answered rostov ""but why have you collected here"" he"
33703,33703,"added ""is it a holiday"""
33704,33704,the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune
33705,33705,and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers
33706,33706,the one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing
33707,33707,dunyasha running resolutely toward him
33708,33708,what do you want my pretty said ilyin with a smile
33709,33709,the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name
33710,33710,"this is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble
servant"
33711,33711,cooompany roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
33712,33712,with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with
33713,33713,chief prince nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this
33714,33714,"these people""he pointed to the peasants""asks you to come up to the"

33716,33716,him as horseflies to a horse
33717,33717,rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled
33718,33718,or perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid
33719,33719,"on a little way ""whats the matter"" he asked"
33720,33720,"i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here
dont wish to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to
unharness her horses so that though everything has been packed up
since morning her excellency cannot get away"
33721,33721,impossible exclaimed rostov
33722,33722,i have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatych
33723,33723,it appeared that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the
33724,33724,actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the
33725,33725,keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent
33726,33726,for him and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to
33727,33727,barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village that
33728,33728,as before and obey her in everything
33729,33729,father benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved
33730,33730,voices as rostov passed through the anteroom
33731,33731,princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large
33732,33732,her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered
33733,33733,and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostov as a
33734,33734,here what gentleness and nobility there are in her features and
33735,33735,"expression"" thought he as he looked at her and listened to her"
33736,33736,timid story
33737,33737,when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day
33738,33738,were tears in rostovs eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced
33739,33739,gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of
33740,33740,her face to be forgotten
33741,33741,one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act
33742,33742,rostovs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
33743,33743,take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her
33744,33744,princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy
33745,33745,"it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it"" she"
33746,33746,suddenly began to cry
33747,33747,excuse me she said
33748,33748,chapter xiv
33749,33749,"well is she pretty ah friendmy pink one is delicious her
name is dunyasha"
33750,33750,but on glancing at rostovs face ilyin stopped short he saw that
33751,33751,his hero and commander was following quite a different train of
33752,33752,thought
33753,33753,rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with
33754,33754,rapid steps to the village
33755,33755,ill show them ill give it to them the brigands said he to
33756,33756,himself
33757,33757,with him with difficulty

33762,33762,kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his
33763,33763,views he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present

34279,34279,had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved
34280,34280,hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind
34281,34281,played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons
34282,34282,decorating the icon the singing did not sound loud under the open
34283,34283,surrounded the icon behind the priest and a chanter stood the
34284,34284,notabilities on a spot reserved for them a bald general with
34285,34285,general with a st georges cross on his neck stood just behind the

34288,34288,expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who
34289,34289,slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long
34290,34290,coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder
34291,34291,meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in
34292,34292,to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and
34293,34293,brilliant suite surrounded him
34294,34294,he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
34295,34295,position
34296,34296,"this is what you must do said boris ""i will do the honors of the"

our left flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice"

34310,34310,invaluable man
34311,34311,in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties
34312,34312,fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now
34313,34313,the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed
34314,34314,it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case
34315,34315,new men would come to the front so boris was full of nervous vivacity
34316,34316,all day
34317,34317,not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered
34318,34318,cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in
34319,34319,the different expression he saw on other facesan expression that
34320,34320,spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life
34321,34321,and death kutuzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered
34322,34322,round him
34323,34323,call him to me said kutuzov
34324,34324,went toward kutuzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it
34325,34325,was dolokhov
34326,34326,how did that fellow get here asked pierre
34327,34327,"hes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer ""he has"
34328,34328,proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picket
34329,34329,"line at night hes a brave fellow"""
34330,34330,pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov
34331,34331,"i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might
send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i
shouldnt lose anything dolokhov was saying"
34332,34332,yes yes
34333,34333,"but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my
fatherland for which i am ready to die"
34334,34334,yes yes
34335,34335,"and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare
his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your
serene highness"
34336,34336,and more as he looked at pierre
34337,34337,conversation
34338,34338,"the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what
heroism count"
34339,34339,boris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by
34340,34340,his serene highness he knew kutuzovs attention would be caught by
34341,34341,what are you saying about the militia he asked boris
34342,34342,"preparing for tomorrow your serene highnessfor deaththey
have put on clean shirts"
34343,34343,ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed

34485,34485,alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
34486,34486,prince andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from
34487,34487,expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him
34488,34488,"a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we
lose the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal
to ours but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the
battle and we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to
fight for there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as
we could weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not
said that till the evening heaven knows what might not have happened
but tomorrow we shant say it you talk about our position the left
flank weak and the right flank too extended he went on ""thats"
34489,34489,tomorrow a hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided
34490,34490,present is only play the fact is that those men with whom you have
34491,34491,"they are only concerned with their own petty interests"""
34492,34492,at such a moment said pierre reproachfully
34493,34493,"at such a moment prince andrew repeated ""to them it is only a"
34494,34494,moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an

34496,34496,hundred thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to

34498,34498,win and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and

34504,34504,conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the
34505,34505,andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack
34506,34506,involuntarily heard these words
34507,34507,"der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht
genug preis geben said one of them"

34516,34516,german heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in

34518,34518,"fine teachers"" and again his voice grew shrill"
34519,34519,so you think we shall win tomorrows battle asked pierre
34520,34520,"yes yes answered prince andrew absently ""one thing i would do"
34521,34521,why take prisoners its chivalry the french have destroyed my home
34522,34522,outraging me every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are
34523,34523,all criminals and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they
34524,34524,should be executed since they are my foes they cannot be my
34525,34525,"andrew ""i quite agree with you"""
34526,34526,the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and
34527,34527,all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he
34528,34528,now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
34529,34529,him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in
34530,34530,and as it were lightheartedly
34531,34531,"not take prisoners prince andrew continued ""that by itself would"
34532,34532,quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have
34533,34533,played at warthats whats vile we play at magnanimity and all that
34534,34534,stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
34535,34535,sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed
34536,34536,its all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in  they
34537,34537,humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples
34538,34538,"has come to this as i have through the same sufferings"""
34539,34539,speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a
34540,34540,quivered as he began speaking
34541,34541,"if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war
only when it was worth while going to certain death as now then
there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael
ivanovich and when there was a war like this one it would be war
and then the determination of the troops would be quite different
then all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading
would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fight in
austria and prussia without knowing why war is not courtesy but the
most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand that and not
play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and
seriously it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be
war and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the
idle and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored

but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are"
34542,34542,the habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of
34543,34543,and fraud and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the
34544,34544,who kills most people receives the highest rewards
34545,34545,live i see that i have begun to understand too much and it doesnt
34546,34546,do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

34655,34655,the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha
34656,34656,had been dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the
34657,34657,back that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it
34658,34658,the ground was more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to
34659,34659,would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this
34660,34660,supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to
34661,34661,napoleon yet the historians who described the event later and the men
34662,34662,napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a
34663,34663,profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them
34664,34664,his final conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a
34665,34665,explaining why not to a proposal made by general campan who was to
34666,34666,remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might
34667,34667,disorder the division
34668,34668,napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots
34669,34669,where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against

34711,34711,simultaneously from the front
34712,34712,not be executed after passing through borodino the viceking was
34713,34713,driven back to the kolocha and could get no farther while the
34714,34714,divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were
34715,34715,by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by
34716,34716,necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle
34717,34717,the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight
34718,34718,could be executed
34719,34719,chapter xxviii
34720,34720,many historians say that the french did not win the battle of
34721,34721,cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been
34722,34722,still more full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face
34723,34723,of the world have been changed to historians who believe that
34724,34724,russia was shaped by the will of one manpeter the greatand that
34725,34725,france from a republic became an empire and french armies went to
34726,34726,russia at the will of one mannapoleonto say that russia remained a
34727,34727,power because napoleon had a bad cold on the twentyfourth of august
34728,34728,may seem logical and convincing
34729,34729,if it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the
34730,34730,omitted to bring napoleon his waterproof boots on the twentyfourth
34731,34731,would have been the savior of russia along that line of thought
34732,34732,voltaire made in jest without knowing what he was jesting at when he
34733,34733,saw that the massacre of st bartholomew was due to charles ixs
34734,34734,stomach being deranged but to men who do not admit that russia was
34735,34735,contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic
34736,34736,human events is predetermined from on highdepends on the coincidence
34737,34737,influence on the course of these events is purely external and
34738,34738,fictitious
34739,34739,strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the
34740,34740,he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that
34741,34741,order and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of
34742,34742,he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it
34743,34743,was done because he ordered it strange as these suppositions
34744,34744,more at least not less a man than the great napoleondemands the
34745,34745,investigation abundantly confirms it
34746,34746,at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one
34747,34747,that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who
34748,34748,killed people
34749,34749,the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of
34750,34750,borodino not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition
34751,34751,blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be
34752,34752,would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians because
34753,34753,it was inevitable
34754,34754,"lempereur"" just as they had cried ""vive lempereur"" at the sight of"
34755,34755,the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy
34756,34756,nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to
34757,34757,and rest as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of
34758,34758,napoleons commands that they killed their fellow men
34759,34759,none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know
34760,34760,what was going on before him so the way in which these people
34761,34761,killed one another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred
34762,34762,of people who took part in the common action it only seemed to
34763,34763,napoleon that it all took place by his will and so the question
34764,34764,whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than
34765,34765,the cold of the least of the transport soldiers
34766,34766,the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former
34767,34767,cold on the twentysixth of august was unimportant
34768,34768,his pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than
34769,34769,only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino
34770,34770,was the first napoleon did not win the profoundest and most excellent
34771,34771,won
34772,34772,the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of
34773,34773,but still they were criticizedcriticized for their very
34774,34774,napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as
34775,34775,battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he
34776,34776,chapter xxix
34777,34777,remarked
34778,34778,the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow
34779,34779,him about paris and about some changes he meant to make the empress
34780,34780,relating to the court
34781,34781,who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on
34782,34782,his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table
34783,34783,"the matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head
when the times comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else
could but now i can jest and the more i jest and the calmer i am the
more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at my
genius"
34784,34784,day he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to
34785,34785,enemys fires were still in the same places he nodded approval
34786,34786,the adjutant in attendance came into the tent
34787,34787,well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon
34788,34788,asked him
34789,34789,without doubt sire replied rapp
34790,34790,napoleon looked at him
34791,34791,"do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at
smolensk continued rapp ""the wine is drawn and must be drunk"""
34792,34792,napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head
34793,34793,on his hand
34794,34794,"this poor army he suddenly remarked ""it has diminished greatly"
34795,34795,"guards are intact"" he remarked interrogatively"
34796,34796,yes sire replied rapp

34798,34798,the orders had all been given and were now being executed

the guards asked napoleon sternly"
34800,34800,yes sire
34801,34801,the rice too
34802,34802,but napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing
34803,34803,that his order had been executed an attendant came in with punch
34804,34804,sipped his own
34805,34805,"glass ""this cold is tiresome they talk about medicinewhat is the"
34806,34806,good of medicine when it cant cure a cold corvisart gave me these

34811,34811,"art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats all"""

34815,34815,weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his
34816,34816,"entrenchments we shall see"""
34817,34817,he looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not
34818,34818,feel sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do
34819,34819,the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to
34820,34820,take up their positions were clearly audible
34821,34821,stopped in front of him
34822,34822,what year did you enter the service he asked with that
34823,34823,affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always
34824,34824,addressed the soldiers
34825,34825,the man answered the question
34826,34826,ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice
34827,34827,it has your majesty

34857,34857,farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious
34858,34858,stone of a yellowishgreen color its undulating outline was
34859,34859,silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond valuevo by
34860,34860,the smolensk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered

34865,34865,magically colored and outlined everything the smoke of the guns
34866,34866,troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodino a white

34870,34870,these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of

34900,34900,firing pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had
34901,34901,which the french having occupied borodino were attacking in the
34902,34902,first phase of the battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front

34904,34904,no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before but
34905,34905,despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this
34906,34906,was the field of battle he did not notice the sound of the bullets
34907,34907,he looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face

34956,34956,enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke

34958,34958,a common and as it were family feeling of animation

34968,34968,kindly fun of him among themselves

35011,35011,this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was
35012,35012,flaming up in the same way in his own soul
35013,35013,at ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in

35023,35023,longdrawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few
35024,35024,minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcherbearers came back
35025,35025,from that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently
35026,35026,in the battery several men were lying about who had not been removed

35065,35065,something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery
35066,35066,he had no time to realize who these men were he saw the senior
35067,35067,officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were
35068,35068,examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had
35069,35069,"noticed before was struggling forward shouting ""brothers"" and"
35070,35070,trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the
35071,35071,arm he also saw something else that was strange

35074,35074,hands and seized the man a french officer by the shoulder with one
35075,35075,for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothers

35084,35084,wildly toward the battery this was the attack for which ermolov
35085,35085,such a feat possible it was the attack in which he was said to have
35086,35086,thrown some st georges crosses he had in his pocket into the battery

35091,35091,of woundedsome known to pierre and some unknownrussians and
35092,35092,carried on stretchers from the battery pierre again went up onto

35097,35097,chapter xxxiii
35098,35098,the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the
35099,35099,seven thousand feet between borodino and bagrations fleches beyond
35100,35100,were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in
35101,35101,the center of the battlefield on the field between borodino and the
35102,35102,open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest
35103,35103,and most artless way
35104,35104,the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
35105,35105,guns
35106,35106,murats troops advanced on borodino from their left
35107,35107,from the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the
35108,35108,the whole locality the soldiers of dessaixs division advancing
35109,35109,against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the
35110,35110,hollow that lay between them and the fleches as soon as they had
35111,35111,the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that
35112,35112,side of it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something
35113,35113,blackprobably menand at times the glint of bayonets but whether
35114,35114,could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt
35115,35115,the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight
35116,35116,impossible to tell what was being done there
35117,35117,could not tell where what he had seen was
35118,35118,he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it
35119,35119,intently at the battlefield
35120,35120,but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from
35121,35121,fleches themselvesin which by this time there were now russian and
35122,35122,impossible to make out what was taking place there for several
35123,35123,it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at
35124,35124,any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the
35125,35125,actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others
35126,35126,and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to
35127,35127,napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already
35128,35128,becoming false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings
35129,35129,that borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in
35130,35130,the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished
35131,35131,the troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should
35132,35132,form up on the farther side and wait but before that order was given
35133,35133,almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodinothe bridge
35134,35134,which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle
35135,35135,an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and
35136,35136,frightened face and reported to napoleon that their attack had been
35137,35137,was alive and only slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily
35138,35138,been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not
35139,35139,executed
35140,35140,arrangements without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in
35141,35141,what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry
35142,35142,contrary to their orders soldiers ordered to advance ran back on
35143,35143,pursuit of the flying russians in this way two cavalry regiments
35144,35144,galloped through the semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached
35145,35145,the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back
35146,35146,quite other places than those they were ordered to go to all orders
35147,35147,shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantryall such orders
35148,35148,they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or
35149,35149,is what is dearest to manhis own lifeand it sometimes seems that
35150,35150,men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the
35151,35151,and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops
35152,35152,harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that
35153,35153,flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about as
35154,35154,soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying
35155,35155,and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that
35156,35156,influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about

35160,35160,huge masses of wellordered troops but contrary to what had always
35161,35161,their numbers constantly decreased in the middle of the day murat
35162,35162,sent his adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements
35163,35163,murats adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would

35169,35169,the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
35170,35170,removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were
35171,35171,being slaughtered
35172,35172,napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began
35173,35173,talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle
35174,35174,who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was
35175,35175,belliard having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid
35176,35176,strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity
35177,35177,of sending reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians
35178,35178,were lost if the emperor would give another division
35179,35179,napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
35180,35180,without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
35181,35181,generals of the suite around him
35182,35182,"to the general ""in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake"
35183,35183,"go and have another look and then come back to me"""
35184,35184,the battlefield galloped up
35185,35185,now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man
35186,35186,irritated at being continually disturbed
35187,35187,sire the prince began the adjutant
35188,35188,asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture
35189,35189,who do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he
35190,35190,"subsequently termed ""that gosling i have made an eagle"""

35193,35193,later the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward
35194,35194,napoleon gazed silently in that direction

35197,35197,though there was no advantage in sending friants division instead

35200,35200,so justly understood and condemned

35202,35202,smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive
35203,35203,at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all
35204,35204,asked for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding
35205,35205,their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the

35356,35356,presentiment
35357,35357,and on the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he
35358,35358,was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on
35359,35359,his muscular brown back
35360,35360,seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew several dressers were
35361,35361,twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor the man was

35369,35369,prince andrew to lose consciousness when he came to himself the
35370,35370,blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all
35371,35371,the best and happiest moments of his lifeespecially his earliest
35372,35372,something present
35373,35373,the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of
35374,35374,whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him
35375,35375,up and trying to quiet him
35376,35376,show it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans
35377,35377,hearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep
35378,35378,and that man near him was groaning so piteouslyhe felt like

35384,35384,"what he saw before him ""what is the connection of that man with my"

35386,35386,suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving
35387,35387,childhood presented itself to him he remembered natasha as he had
35388,35388,awoke in his soul he now remembered the connection that existed
35389,35389,between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears
35390,35390,pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart
35391,35391,prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender
35392,35392,their errors
35393,35393,"compassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for
those who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god
preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not

35395,35395,the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and
35396,35396,produced an unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to
35397,35397,strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of the
35398,35398,battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought
35399,35399,constituted his merit and his greatness he rode hurriedly from the
35400,35400,brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he
35401,35401,had served so long he felt in his own person the sufferings and death
35402,35402,he had witnessed on the battlefield the heaviness of his head and
35403,35403,chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for
35404,35404,what need had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for
35405,35405,semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring
35406,35406,several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the
35407,35407,fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovo napoleon had
35408,35408,assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of
35409,35409,the effect those batteries produced
35410,35410,an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
35411,35411,they still held their ground
35412,35412,our fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said
35413,35413,the adjutant
35414,35414,they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice

35416,35416,"they want more croaked napoleon frowning ""let them have it"""
35417,35417,for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of
35418,35418,thinks it is doing something for itselfhe submissively fulfilled the
35419,35419,and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
35420,35420,darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
35421,35421,lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the
35422,35422,significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
35423,35423,there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone
35424,35424,"did he write in a letter to paris that ""the battle field was"
35425,35425,it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french
35426,35426,the russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand
35427,35427,men the russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in
35428,35428,the various battles four times more men than the french army the
35429,35429,burning of moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who

35431,35431,the season so that by the the time it reached vilna it numbered
35432,35432,horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul he boldly took the
35433,35433,justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
35434,35434,perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians

35452,35452,perspiring and stained with blood and powder the cannon balls flew
35453,35453,and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but

35455,35455,anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would
35456,35456,would disappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army
35457,35457,would have said that the russians need only make one more slight
35458,35458,effort and the french would be destroyed but neither the french nor
35459,35459,out
35460,35460,the russians did not make that effort because they were not
35461,35461,attacking the french at the beginning of the battle they stood
35462,35462,blocking the way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the
35463,35463,battle as at the beginning but even had the aim of the russians
35464,35464,half of their army
35465,35465,the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and
35466,35466,had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards
35467,35467,the french had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its
35468,35468,had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain
35469,35469,but the french did not make that effort some historians say that
35470,35470,the battle would have been won to speak of what would have happened
35471,35471,had napoleon sent his guards is like talking of what would happen if
35472,35472,autumn became spring it could not be napoleon did not give his
35473,35473,would not permit it
35474,35474,it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
35475,35475,after all their experience of previous battleswhen after one tenth
35476,35476,of such efforts the enemy had fledexperienced a similar feeling of
35477,35477,threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle the
35478,35478,moral force of the attacking french army was exhausted not that

35491,35491,as the tortoise by the time achilles has covered the distance that
35492,35492,this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that
35493,35493,achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that
35494,35494,the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continuous

35498,35498,with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more
35499,35499,complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble
35500,35500,dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the
35501,35501,absolute continuity and thereby corrects the inevitable error
35502,35502,which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements
35503,35503,of motion instead of examining continuous motion
35504,35504,in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing
35505,35505,to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
35506,35506,units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily
35507,35507,always flows uninterruptedly from another
35508,35508,the second method is to consider the actions of some one mana king
35509,35509,or a commanderas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills
35510,35510,whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity
35511,35511,of a single historic personage
35512,35512,historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth
35513,35513,continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination but
35514,35514,it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any
35515,35515,deductions drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some
35516,35516,larger or smaller unit as the subject of observationas criticism has
35517,35517,always be arbitrarily selected
35518,35518,only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the
35519,35519,of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history

35521,35521,present an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave
35522,35522,and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an

35540,35540,the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the
35541,35541,the oak is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold
35542,35542,peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold

35544,35544,must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the
35545,35545,the same and attempts in this direction have already been made
35546,35546,to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject
35547,35547,moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
35548,35548,in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it
35549,35549,is evident that only along that path does the possibility of
35550,35550,part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by
35551,35551,historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various
35552,35552,reflections concerning these actions
35553,35553,chapter ii
35554,35554,the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the
35555,35555,and again from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to
35556,35556,just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches
35557,35557,hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its
35558,35558,goal every soldier in napoleons army felt this and the invasion
35559,35559,moved on by its own momentum
35560,35560,the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of
35561,35561,increased and consolidated at borodino a collision took place
35562,35562,after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding
35563,35563,the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on
35564,35564,force
35565,35565,the russians retreated eighty milesto beyond moscowand the
35566,35566,french reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks
35567,35567,after that there was not a single battle the french did not move
35568,35568,a victoryfor at maloyaroslavets the field of conflict again
35569,35569,whole russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a
35570,35570,victory kutuzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare
35571,35571,for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive
35572,35572,had taken part in the battle knew it
35573,35573,but all that evening and next day reports came in one after
35574,35574,fresh battle proved physically impossible
35575,35575,it was impossible to give battle before information had been
35576,35576,the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse
35577,35577,proportion to the square of the distance from its aim kutuzovs
35578,35578,same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third days
35579,35579,near moscowdespite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in
35580,35580,all ranksthe force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond
35581,35581,abandoned moscow to the enemy
35582,35582,for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles
35583,35583,are made by generalsas any one of us sitting over a map in his study
35584,35584,may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that
35585,35585,battlethe questions present themselves why did kutuzov during the
35586,35586,retreat not do this or that why did he not take up a position
35587,35587,before reaching fili why did he not retire at once by the kaluga
35588,35588,limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a
35589,35589,commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to
35590,35590,ourselves when we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign
35591,35591,a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event
35592,35592,the position from which we always contemplate it the commander in
35593,35593,chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so
35594,35594,he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event
35595,35595,that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping
35596,35596,shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most
35597,35597,conflict with one another
35598,35598,learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov
35599,35599,should have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching
35600,35600,before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these
35601,35601,choose one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and
35602,35602,gallops up from miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french
35603,35603,order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kaluga road and
35604,35604,after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the
35605,35605,from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of
35606,35606,is undermining him and there are always not merely one but several
35607,35607,refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has
35608,35608,officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite
35609,35609,the position of the enemys army differently people accustomed to
35610,35610,misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a
35611,35611,position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief

35618,35618,kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond
35619,35619,moscow without a battle
35620,35620,brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed
35621,35621,questions generally though they had not been summoned for the
35622,35622,was really a council of war the conversations all dealt with public
35623,35623,evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the
35624,35624,formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might
35625,35625,overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being
35626,35626,himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after
35627,35627,hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he
35628,35628,were not speaking of anything he wished to hear some discussed the
35629,35629,so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others
35630,35630,argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should
35631,35631,have been fought two days before others again spoke of the battle

35633,35633,german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege
35634,35634,of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in
35635,35635,a similar manner count rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he
35636,35636,was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the
35637,35637,the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group was
35638,35638,talking absolute nonsense kutuzovs expression grew more and more
35639,35639,preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that
35640,35640,to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
35641,35641,result but the battle would still not take place it would not take
35642,35642,place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to
35643,35643,would happen after its inevitable abandonment how could the
35644,35644,commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered
35645,35645,impossible to hold the lowergrade officers and even the soldiers
35646,35646,who too reason also considered the position impossible and therefore
35647,35647,bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still
35648,35648,only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutuzov knew well
35649,35649,patriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing by
35650,35650,insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as
35651,35651,kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without
35652,35652,moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one
35653,35653,terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no
35654,35654,"reply from anyone the question for him now was ""have i really"
35655,35655,decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to

35657,35657,"must retreat and the order to do so must be given"" to give that"
35658,35658,terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of
35659,35659,the army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed
35660,35660,was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in
35661,35661,horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something
35662,35662,assuming too free a character must be stopped
35663,35663,he called the most important generals to him

35672,35672,highness did not wish his face to be seen
35673,35673,forehead merging into his bald crown he had a st georges cross

35680,35680,for him from four till six oclock and did not begin their
35681,35681,deliberations all that time talked in low tones of other matters

35705,35705,they all felt that there was no more to be said

35707,35707,preparing to speak they all looked at him
35708,35708,after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
35709,35709,something to their commander in chief

35722,35722,after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow

35725,35725,feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers
35726,35726,the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the
35727,35727,the participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the
35728,35728,strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment
35729,35729,and as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away
35730,35730,destroyed what was left
35731,35731,the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was
35732,35732,and is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of
35733,35733,russian moscow society in  those who had quitted moscow already
35734,35734,in july and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this
35735,35735,which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving ones children to
35736,35736,most powerful results
35737,35737,"it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running
away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin"
35738,35738,impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed
35739,35739,it had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that
35740,35740,rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had
35741,35741,committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the
35742,35742,rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had
35743,35743,remained intact and that during napoleons occupation the
35744,35744,inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the
35745,35745,they went away because for russians there could be no question as to
35746,35746,whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it
35747,35747,thing that could happen they went away even before the battle of
35748,35748,to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the
35749,35749,nonsense rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets they knew that it was
35750,35750,do to take young ladies and house serfs to the three hills quarter
35751,35751,were to abandon their property to destruction they went away
35752,35752,without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and
35753,35753,wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be
35754,35754,consequence of their going away that the momentous event was

binding you swerved from it what did you commit by so acting a
venial or a mortal sin a venial sin for you acted without evil

35839,35839,have opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the
35840,35840,unfortunate and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men
35841,35841,she should marry the question was no longer whether this was
35842,35842,in helenes good fortune and in the question which match would be
35843,35843,the more advantageous whether it was right or wrong to remarry

destroy the temple of their fatherland you can understand that
there are reasons for this and that i could not have exiled the
postmaster had he not been a harmful person it has now come to my
knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town
and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody i
like you and dont wish you any harm andas you are only half my age
i advise you as a father would to cease all communication with men
of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible"

thats all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear goodby

36059,36059,pierre did not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and
36060,36060,angry than he had ever before shown himself
36061,36061,when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight
36062,36062,petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions
36063,36063,from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of
36064,36064,these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these
36065,36065,people when left alone at last he opened and read his wifes letter
36066,36066,"they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old
man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary
the meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting
married one must forget and understand and going to his bed"

36084,36084,would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of
36085,36085,places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as
36086,36086,nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved
36087,36087,her firstborn more than all her other children and even reproached
36088,36088,herself for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad
36089,36089,eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show
36090,36090,fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure

36116,36116,all his time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by
36117,36117,getting things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and
36118,36118,silent nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had
36119,36119,saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess
36120,36120,and nicholas
36121,36121,i was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said the
36122,36122,"a presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be"""
36123,36123,sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of
36124,36124,and that the princess was a good match it was very bitter for her
36125,36125,herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of
36126,36126,their things and was busy for whole days the count and countess
36127,36127,turned to her when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on
36128,36128,nuisance and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house
36129,36129,spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there
36130,36130,hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and
36131,36131,laughter to them petya was in high spirits because having left home a
36132,36132,was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to moscow
36133,36133,was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her
36134,36134,also happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of
36135,36135,others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them
36136,36136,chapter xiii
36137,36137,serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet
36138,36138,the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants
36139,36139,who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another
36140,36140,in the yard and in the house the count bad been out since morning
36141,36141,the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil
36142,36142,and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress
36143,36143,whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active
36144,36144,army sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass
36145,36145,and china natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room
36146,36146,fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress
36147,36147,already out of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg
36148,36148,ball
36149,36149,except with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood
36150,36150,soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things at
36151,36151,first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the
36152,36152,dunyasha you pack you will wont you dear and when dunyasha
36153,36153,unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was
36154,36154,roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room
36155,36155,which was theirs and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going
36156,36156,to the back porch natasha got up and looked out of the window an
36157,36157,enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the
36158,36158,street
36159,36159,"then you have nobody in moscow she was saying ""you would be more"
36160,36160,"family are leaving"""
36161,36161,i dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak
36162,36162,the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile
36163,36163,eyes and smiling
36164,36164,as if considering in how far the thing was possiblereplied in the
36165,36165,affirmative
36166,36166,oh yes why not they may he said
36167,36167,officer
36168,36168,they may he says they may whispered natasha
36169,36169,and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
36170,36170,townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of
36171,36171,the houses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be
36172,36172,dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life
36173,36173,she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as
36174,36174,possible into their yard
36175,36175,your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna
36176,36176,"never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can
move into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house"
36177,36177,"there now young lady you do take things into your head even if
we put them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we
must ask permission"
36178,36178,well ill ask
36179,36179,natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the
36180,36180,vinegar and hoffmans drops
36181,36181,are you asleep mamma
36182,36182,dropping into a doze
36183,36183,it again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have
36184,36184,brought some wounded hereofficers will you let them come they have
36185,36185,"nowhere to go i knew youd let them come"" she said quickly all in"
36186,36186,one breath
36187,36187,"what officers whom have they brought i dont understand
anything about it said the countess"
36188,36188,weve stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation
36189,36189,the club is closed and the police are leaving
36190,36190,"papa is it all rightive invited some of the wounded into the
house said natasha"
36191,36191,"of course it is he answered absently ""thats not the point i"
36192,36192,and the count gave a similar order to the majordomo and the
36193,36193,servants
36194,36194,at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had
36195,36195,that though rostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a
36196,36196,that there would be a big battle there
36197,36197,face as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his
36198,36198,not going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the
36199,36199,dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take
36200,36200,said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very
36201,36201,night without any pretense she was now afraid of everything
36202,36202,chapter xiv
36203,36203,countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
36204,36204,dealers in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had
36205,36205,been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the
36206,36206,shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
36207,36207,cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels
36208,36208,after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with
36209,36209,enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their
36210,36210,to work too at first her intervention in the business of packing
36211,36211,was received skeptically everybody expected some prank from her and
36212,36212,did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and passionately demanded
36213,36213,gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natasha
36214,36214,the storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to
36215,36215,fetch it
36216,36216,sonya wait a bitwell pack everything into these said natasha
36217,36217,you cant miss we have tried to said the butlers assistant
36218,36218,no wait a minute please
36219,36219,and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
36220,36220,wrapped in paper
36221,36221,the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she
36222,36222,"why its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three
cases said the butlers assistant"
36223,36223,oh wait please and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out
36224,36224,but natasha would not give in she turned everything out and began
36225,36225,unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had
36226,36226,out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all
36227,36227,only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a
36228,36228,assistant and petyawhom she had drawn into the business of
36229,36229,"just take out the top one"""
36230,36230,cried
36231,36231,screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only
36232,36232,lasted a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted
36233,36233,her completely the count was not angry even when they told him that
36234,36234,might be corded up thanks to natashas directions the work now went
36235,36235,valuable packed as compactly as possible
36236,36236,not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the
36237,36237,sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing
36238,36238,into the rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very
36239,36239,important man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised
36240,36240,driver sat a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers
36241,36241,followed the carriage in a cart
36242,36242,"please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house
will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant"
36243,36243,"well perhaps said he with a sigh ""we dont expect to get him"
36244,36244,"do us the honor to come in theres plenty of everything in the
masters house come in said mavra kuzminichna ""is he very ill"""
36245,36245,she asked
36246,36246,the attendant made a hopeless gesture
36247,36247,we dont expect to get him home we must ask the doctor
36248,36248,and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart
36249,36249,all right said the doctor
36250,36250,stopped beside mavra kuzminichna
36251,36251,o lord jesus christ she murmured
36252,36252,she invited them to take the wounded man into the house
36253,36253,the masters wont object she said
36254,36254,him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame
36255,36255,schoss
36256,36256,this wounded man was prince andrew bolkonski
36257,36257,chapter xv
36258,36258,as usual on sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the
36259,36259,city
36260,36260,only two things indicated the social condition of moscowthe
36261,36261,early that morning to the three hills having waited there for
36262,36262,public houses and cookshops prices too that day indicated the state
36263,36263,so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable
36264,36264,in the rostovs staid oldfashioned house the dissolution of
36265,36265,former conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs
36266,36266,the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue
36267,36267,in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be
36268,36268,extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for
36269,36269,the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of
36270,36270,rostovs and wounded men dragged themselves there from the rostovs
36271,36271,the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the majordomo
36272,36272,evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to
36273,36273,thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general
36274,36274,catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and ones own family so
36275,36275,thought the majordomo on his masters behalf
36276,36276,so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward
36277,36277,the yard stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front
36278,36278,porch the majordomo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly
36279,36279,and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count
36280,36280,the majordomo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go
36281,36281,away
36282,36282,his bald head he looked goodnaturedly at the officer and the
36283,36283,orderly and nodded to them he liked to see new faces
36284,36284,we can harness at once your excellency
36285,36285,are you staying in my house
36286,36286,the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson
36287,36287,"count be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into
some corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i
shall be all right on a loaded cart"
36288,36288,before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
36289,36289,request on behalf of his master
36290,36290,"oh yes yes yes said the count hastily ""i shall be very"
36291,36291,but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the
36292,36292,officers face had already sealed the order the count looked around
36293,36293,officers and their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at
36294,36294,the count and moving toward the porch
36295,36295,please step into the gallery your excellency said the
36296,36296,"majordomo ""what are your orders about the pictures"""
36297,36297,refuse the wounded who asked for a lift
36298,36298,well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added
36299,36299,had been her ladys maid before her marriage and now performed a
36300,36300,schoss was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses could
36301,36301,schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its
36302,36302,out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the
36303,36303,simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them
36304,36304,the countess sent for her husband
36305,36305,what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded
36306,36306,"you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer
came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are
things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
them really now in our own yardwe asked them in ourselves and
there are officers among them you know i think my dear let
them be taken wheres the hurry"
36307,36307,matters the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of
36308,36308,private theater or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose
36309,36309,anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do
36310,36310,so
36311,36311,she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband
36312,36312,"listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are
getting nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all our
all the childrens property you said yourself that we have a
hundred thousand rubles worth of things in the house i dont
consent my dear i dont do as you please its the governments
business to look after the wounded they know that look at the
lopukhins opposite they cleared out everything two days ago thats
what other people do its only we who are such fools if you have
no pity on me have some for the children"
36313,36313,flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
36314,36314,replying
36315,36315,him into her mothers room
36316,36316,nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily
36317,36317,"but i heard said natasha ""why does mamma object"""
36318,36318,what business is it of yours cried the count
36319,36319,natasha stepped up to the window and pondered
36320,36320,window
36321,36321,chapter xvi
36322,36322,agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the
36323,36323,assistant commander of the first division of the second army
36324,36324,on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army
36325,36325,in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something
36326,36326,to do there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence
36327,36327,for family and domestic reasons
36328,36328,berg drove up to his fatherinlaws house in his spruce little trap
36329,36329,looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to
36330,36330,the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it
36331,36331,from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into
36332,36332,"news is the army retreating or will there be another battle"""
36333,36333,god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa
36334,36334,"said berg ""the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the"
36335,36335,"it"" he corrected himself ""has shown or displayed in the battle of"
36336,36336,the twentysixththere are no words worthy to do it justice i tell
36337,36337,"assure you our corps was stationed on a hillside you can imagine"""
36338,36338,and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he
36339,36339,had heard those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that
36340,36340,to some question
36341,36341,just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary
36342,36342,"yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad
times for every russian but why are you so anxious you have still
time to get away"
36343,36343,"turning to her husband ""i have just been told that nothing is ready"
36344,36344,yet somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such
36345,36345,"times there wont be any end to it"""
36346,36346,himself he got up from his chair and went to the door
36347,36347,at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
36348,36348,significantly
36349,36349,and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he
36350,36350,i was driving past yusupovs house just now said berg with a
36351,36351,there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear
36352,36352,"vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it"""
36353,36353,at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg
36354,36354,involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable
36355,36355,"domestic arrangements ""and its such a beauty it pulls out and"
36356,36356,the count frowned and coughed
36357,36357,ask the countess i dont give orders
36358,36358,"if its inconvenient please dont said berg ""only i so wanted"
36359,36359,"oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the
devil cried the old count ""my heads in a whirl"""
36360,36360,and he left the room the countess began to cry
36361,36361,yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg
36362,36362,downstairs
36363,36363,servants who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still
36364,36364,standing in the yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded
36365,36365,officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly
36366,36366,do you know what its about petya asked natasha
36367,36367,she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling
36368,36368,about she did not answer
36369,36369,"its because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the
wounded said petya ""vasilich told me i consider"""
36370,36370,"dont know what are we despicable germans"""
36371,36371,headlong up the stairs
36372,36372,berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the
36373,36373,steps
36374,36374,"its horrid its abominable she screamed ""you cant possibly"
36375,36375,"have ordered it"""
36376,36376,count stood still at the window and listened
36377,36377,mamma its impossible see what is going on in the yard she
36378,36378,"cried ""they will be left"""
36379,36379,whats the matter with you who are they what do you want
36380,36380,"why the wounded its impossible mamma its monstrous no
mamma darling its not the thing please forgive me darling
mamma what does it matter what we take away only look what is
going on in the yard mamma its impossible"
36381,36381,the count stood by the window and listened without turning round
36382,36382,suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window
36383,36383,surrendering at once
36384,36384,mamma darling forgive me
36385,36385,but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her
36386,36386,husband
36387,36387,the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count
36388,36388,her look of shame on his breast
36389,36389,"papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha ""we will"
36390,36390,"still take all the most necessary things"""
36391,36391,the anteroom and downstairs into the yard
36392,36392,wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood
36393,36393,that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and
36394,36394,zeal it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it
36395,36395,before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should
36396,36396,be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the
36397,36397,only thing to do
36398,36398,set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the
36399,36399,carts the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood
36400,36400,with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to
36401,36401,began to come into the rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them

36498,36498,"doing why are you like this"""
36499,36499,pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he
36500,36500,walked along beside her while the coach still moved on
36501,36501,what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and
36502,36502,commiserating tone
36503,36503,without looking at herfilled him with enchantment

36511,36511,"oh dont ask me dont ask me i dont know myself tomorrow
but no goodby goodby he muttered ""its an awful time"" and"
36512,36512,dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement
36513,36513,chapter xviii
36514,36514,how it happened
36515,36515,when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his
36516,36516,where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that
36517,36517,among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a
36518,36518,he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and
36519,36519,hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb he felt that everything
36520,36520,no escape from this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to
36521,36521,majordomo came in a second time to say that the frenchman who had
36522,36522,brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if
36523,36523,leaving for the country
36524,36524,"oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say
i will come directly pierre replied to the majordomo"
36525,36525,but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat
36526,36526,which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other
36527,36527,door there was no one in the passage he went along the whole
36528,36528,hall porter was standing at the front door from the landing where
36529,36529,pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back
36530,36530,entrance he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one
36531,36531,pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter
36532,36532,noticed him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being
36533,36533,looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in
36534,36534,order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went
36535,36535,down the street
36536,36536,of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph
36537,36537,bazdeevs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary
36538,36538,he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
36539,36539,continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that
36540,36540,began to talk to his driver
36541,36541,the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the
36542,36542,kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the
36543,36543,three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there
36544,36544,having reached the patriarchs ponds pierre found the bazdeevs
36545,36545,his knock
36546,36546,at home asked pierre
36547,36547,"owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to
the torzhok estate with the children your excellency"
36548,36548,i will come in all the same i have to look through the books

36550,36550,"be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my
late mastermay the kingdom of heaven be hishas remained here
but he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant"
36551,36551,pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeevs halfinsane
36552,36552,brother and a hard drinker
36553,36553,yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the
36554,36554,house
36555,36555,pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage
36556,36556,"he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your
honor sees said gerasim ""will you step into the study"" pierre"
36557,36557,danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to
36558,36558,"have the books"""
36559,36559,pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
36560,36560,untouched since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier
36561,36561,gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe
36562,36562,scotch acts with bazdeevs notes and explanations he sat down at
36563,36563,resting his head on his hand sank into meditation
36564,36564,gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw
36565,36565,pierre always sitting in the same attitude
36566,36566,more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making
36567,36567,not hear him
36568,36568,is the cabman to be discharged your honor
36569,36569,"you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow"""
36570,36570,we heard so replied the man
36571,36571,i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you
36572,36572,"yes your excellency replied gerasim ""will you have something to"
36573,36573,"eat"""
36574,36574,yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment
36575,36575,all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactors
36576,36576,another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made
36577,36577,up for him there
36578,36578,eveningwithout even asking himself what they were wanted forhe
36579,36579,the pistol next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening
36580,36580,shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and
36581,36581,looked ingratiatingly at pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward
36582,36582,him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and
36583,36583,angry look and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the
36584,36584,coachmans coat which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected
36585,36585,by steam was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the

36594,36594,napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at
36595,36595,the panorama spread out before him from the twentysixth of august to
36596,36596,delight us continually by falling from the sky
36597,36597,at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather
36598,36598,still held
36599,36599,the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the
36600,36600,cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight
36601,36601,and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that
36602,36602,has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full
36603,36603,every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every
36604,36604,and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before
36605,36605,"a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her
honor thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from"
36606,36606,that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen

36612,36612,and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy
36613,36613,it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking
36614,36614,place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander
36615,36615,"from the height of the kremlinyes there is the kremlin yesi
will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of true
civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their
conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not and do
not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy
of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i
will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not
wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch
boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace
and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will
inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly
impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in
moscow yes there she lies"

36621,36621,same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to
36622,36622,the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that
36623,36623,speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it
36624,36624,he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended
36625,36625,to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for
36626,36626,would win the hearts of the people having learned that there were
36627,36627,many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he
36628,36628,be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts
36629,36629,of the russiansand being like all frenchmen unable to imagine
36630,36630,pauvre mere he decided that he would place an inscription on all

perish do they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard"
36857,36857,saying more and more frequently
36858,36858,chapter xxiv
36859,36859,and because kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in
36860,36860,the defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed
36861,36861,and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite
36862,36862,after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutuzov this
36863,36863,letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops
36864,36864,moscow this was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow
36865,36865,would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day
36866,36866,with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but ever since the battle of
36867,36867,and half the inhabitants had left the city with rostopchins own
36868,36868,permission yet all the same this information astonished and irritated
36869,36869,when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his
36870,36870,by two important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow
36871,36871,and expedite the departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this
36872,36872,"twofold aim all rostopchins actions appear irreproachable ""why"

36875,36875,to presence the tranquillity of the city explains count rostopchin
36876,36876,"why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices and
leppichs balloon and other articles removed ""to leave the town"
36877,36877,all administrators that he controlled the external actions of
36878,36878,coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not
36879,36879,understand from those in authority rostopchin was so pleased with the
36880,36880,that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow
36881,36881,without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt
36882,36882,did not prepare for it the inhabitants left against his wishes if
36883,36883,demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly he was
36884,36884,absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the
36885,36885,long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his
36886,36886,himself mentally to this new position of affairs
36887,36887,all his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful
36888,36888,and had any effect on the people is another question had been
36889,36889,simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of
36890,36890,patriotic hatred of the french
36891,36891,when selfconfidence was of no avail in relation to the one question
36892,36892,rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself
36893,36893,was no longer possible to take the whole of it away
36894,36894,who is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he
36895,36895,firmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villains

36898,36898,to him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the

orders to go against the french and they shouted something about

36937,36937,up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might
36938,36938,mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it

french hell show you what law is the mob were saying as if"

36955,36955,coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a
36956,36956,covered by short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue

36963,36963,while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step
36964,36964,rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand
36965,36965,hopelessly at the counts first words he raised it slowly and
36966,36966,looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet
36967,36967,his eye but rostopchin did not look at him a vein in the young mans

37190,37190,obsessed by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this
37191,37191,heard appeared to him like a dream
37192,37192,he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes
37193,37193,alexeevichs study he really found it when he sat with his elbows
37194,37194,calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after
37195,37195,of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared
37196,37196,mentally classed as they when gerasim roused him from his reverie the
37197,37197,idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow
37198,37198,which he knew was projected and with that object he had asked gerasim
37199,37199,intentions of remaining in joseph alexeevichs house and keeping his
37200,37200,name secret then during the first day spent in inaction and
37201,37201,solitude he tried several times to fix his attention on the masonic
37202,37202,occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in
37203,37203,connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presented itself
37204,37204,to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
37205,37205,often passed through his mind and left no trace behind
37206,37206,"rostovs and natasha had said to him ""are you remaining in"
37207,37207,"moscow how splendid"" the thought flashed into his mind that it"
37208,37208,remain there and do what he was predestined to do
37209,37209,but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be
37210,37210,possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he
37211,37211,which it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon
37212,37212,pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in
37213,37213,shot and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out
37214,37214,his design excited him still more
37215,37215,two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this
37216,37216,purpose the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and
37217,37217,caused him to go to mozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make his way
37218,37218,to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away
37219,37219,same food as gerasim the other was that vague and quite russian
37220,37220,humanfor everything the majority of men regard as the greatest
37221,37221,good in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and
37222,37222,and guardif it has any worth has so only by reason the joy with
37223,37223,which it can all be renounced
37224,37224,it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his
37225,37225,no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money
37226,37226,he possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions
37227,37227,from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the
37228,37228,first time at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its
37229,37229,this moment pierre was supported in his design and prevented from
37230,37230,renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction if he
37231,37231,he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless
37232,37232,sensitive
37233,37233,without beddingall this kept him in a state of excitement
37234,37234,bordering on insanity
37235,37235,it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already
37236,37236,his mind in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either

37247,37247,to arms board them no you shant get it he yelled
37248,37248,steer makar alexeevich by the elbows back to the door

37254,37254,door
37255,37255,the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle

37274,37274,rooms in the house

37288,37288,explained who makar alexeevich was and how just before their arrival

37290,37290,deed go unpunished
37291,37291,the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with
37292,37292,his arm
37293,37293,taking the arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for
37294,37294,you will be called in when you are wanted he said

37296,37296,"he ""shall i serve them up"""
37297,37297,yes and some wine answered the captain
37298,37298,chapter xxix
37299,37299,when the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter
37300,37300,again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and
37301,37301,down with him in the parlorthe first room they entered to
37302,37302,evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering
37303,37303,that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his
37304,37304,life
37305,37305,had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving
37306,37306,mans animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed
37307,37307,pierre
37308,37308,looking at pierres fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his
37309,37309,"finger ""i owe my life to you and offer you my friendship a frenchman"
37310,37310,never forgets either an insult or a service i offer you my
37311,37311,"friendship that is all i can say"""
37312,37312,there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of

37315,37315,"the ambulance with that maniacs bullet in my body"""
37316,37316,began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason
37317,37317,"oh please said he ""i understand your reasons you are an"
37318,37318,officer a superior officer perhaps you have borne arms against us
37319,37319,thats not my business i owe you my life that is enough for me i am
37320,37320,"quite at your service you belong to the gentry"" he concluded with"
37321,37321,"a shade of inquiry in his tone pierre bent his head ""your"
37322,37322,"say thats all i want to know"""
37323,37323,when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and

37326,37326,and had been given a special name they called it limonade de cochon
37327,37327,had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they had
37328,37328,applied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to
37329,37329,its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
37330,37330,pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the
37331,37331,captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through
37332,37332,dinner
37333,37333,"yes my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for
saving me from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my

37340,37340,"pierre terrible in battle gallant with the fair"" he winked and"
37341,37341,pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked
37342,37342,"merrily at him probably the word ""gallant"" turned the captains"
37343,37343,thoughts to the state of moscow
37344,37344,"apropos tell me please is it true that the women have all left
moscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of"
37345,37345,"would not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered
it asked pierre"
37346,37346,"patting pierre on the shoulder ""what a thing to say"" he exclaimed"
37347,37347,paris but paris paris
37348,37348,paristhe capital of the world pierre finished his remark for
37349,37349,him
37350,37350,the captain looked at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in
37351,37351,eyes
37352,37352,"well if you hadnt told me you were russian i should have wagered
that you were parisian you have that i dont know what that"
37353,37353,i have been in paris i spent years there said pierre
37354,37354,"oh yes one sees that plainly paris a man who doesnt know
paris is a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is
talma la duchenois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and"

37356,37356,"less for it"""
37357,37357,involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and goodnatured man
37358,37358,pierre interrupted him
37359,37359,"the emperor he is generosity mercy justice order genius
thats what the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i
assure you i was his enemy eight years ago my father was an
emigrant count but that man has vanquished me he has taken hold
of me i could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with
which he has covered france when i understood what he wantedwhen
i saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us you know i
said to myself that is a monarch and i devoted myself to him so
there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest man of the ages past or
future"
37360,37360,is he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look
37361,37361,the frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled
37362,37362,talk
37363,37363,their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
37364,37364,had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the
37365,37365,captains horses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because
37366,37366,the hussars did not understand what was said to them in french
37367,37367,two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his
37368,37368,that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had
37369,37369,the captains reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had
37370,37370,elsewhere the captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in
37371,37371,a loud voice
37372,37372,when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place as
37373,37373,really was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and
37374,37374,position he was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that
37375,37375,the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him
37376,37376,painful as that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the
37377,37377,moment he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the
37378,37378,few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this
37379,37379,goodnatured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which
37380,37380,he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the
37381,37381,ready napoleon was to enter the town next day pierre still
37382,37382,considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the
37383,37383,intention he struggled against the confession of his weakness but
37384,37384,dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy
37385,37385,had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met
37386,37386,tune
37387,37387,the frenchmans chatter which had previously amused pierre now
37388,37388,"then"""
37389,37389,pierre looked at him in silence
37390,37390,what is the german for shelter
37391,37391,"shelter pierre repeated ""the german for shelter is unterkunft"""
37392,37392,how do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully
37393,37393,unterkunft pierre repeated
37394,37394,onterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some
37395,37395,"well lets have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux shall
we morel will warm us up another little bottle morel he called out"
37396,37396,gaily
37397,37397,morel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked at
37398,37398,pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled
37399,37399,perhaps its the state of affairs
37400,37400,eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him
37401,37401,chest
37402,37402,thank you said pierre
37403,37403,the captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned
37404,37404,brightened
37405,37405,filling two glasses with wine
37406,37406,pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied
37407,37407,table in a pensive attitude
37408,37408,would have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons
37409,37409,and with a frenchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told
37410,37410,story
37411,37411,another glass
37412,37412,pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third
37413,37413,eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all ramballes
37414,37414,love stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the
37415,37415,sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the
37416,37416,charm of love and he described women so alluringly that pierre
37417,37417,listened to him with curiosity
37418,37418,it was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not
37419,37419,was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
37420,37420,natasha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the
37421,37421,"one he considered the ""love of clodhoppers"" and the other the ""love of"
37422,37422,"simpletons"" lamour which the frenchman worshiped consisted"
37423,37423,principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
37424,37424,combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling
37425,37425,thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
37426,37426,fascinating marquise of thirtyfive and at the same time for a
37427,37427,marquise the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the
37428,37428,is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the
37429,37429,"young girls are ""too blonde"""
37430,37430,of life continually occurred in the captains stories and the pole
37431,37431,had entrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while
37432,37432,repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a
37433,37433,touching recollection
37434,37434,the evening and under the influence of winefollowed all that was
37435,37435,mind while listening to these love stories his own love for natasha
37436,37436,love in his imagination he mentally compared them with ramballes
37437,37437,pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting
37438,37438,with the object of his love at the sukharev water tower at the time
37439,37439,of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon himhe had not
37440,37440,even once recalled it but now it seemed to him that that meeting
37441,37441,had had in it something very important and poetic
37442,37442,peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed
37443,37443,there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this
37444,37444,captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to
37445,37445,sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate
37446,37446,husband
37447,37447,challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need
37448,37448,to express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that
37449,37449,he understood love for a women somewhat differently he said that in
37450,37450,could never be his
37451,37451,tiens said the captain
37452,37452,pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
37453,37453,afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think
37454,37454,he understood that
37455,37455,the captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not
37456,37456,understand it he begged pierre to continue
37457,37457,platonic love clouds he muttered
37458,37458,urged on by ramballes questions he also told what he had at first
37459,37459,concealedhis own position and even his name
37460,37460,more than anything else in pierres story the captain was
37461,37461,but remained there concealing his name and station
37462,37462,when it was late at night they went out together into the street
37463,37463,the night was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka
37464,37464,a fire glowedthe first of those that were beginning in moscow to
37465,37465,the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
37466,37466,opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in
37467,37467,two frenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible
37468,37468,remarks in two languages could be heard they were looking at the glow
37469,37469,seen in the town
37470,37470,immense city
37471,37471,remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he
37472,37472,leaned against the fence to save himself from falling
37473,37473,unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
37474,37474,immediately fell asleep
37475,37475,chapter xxx
37476,37476,the glow of the first fire that began on the second of september was
37477,37477,watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by the
37478,37478,to spend that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next
37479,37479,morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they
37480,37480,only got as far as great mytishchi at ten oclock that evening the
37481,37481,rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed
37482,37482,in the yards and huts of that large village the rostovs servants and
37483,37483,porches
37484,37484,in a neighboring hut lay raevskis adjutant with a fractured
37485,37485,wrist the awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and
37486,37486,autumn night he had spent the first night in the same yard as the
37487,37487,rostovs the countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on
37488,37488,simply to be farther away from the wounded man
37489,37489,of another fire one glow had long been visible and everybody knew
37490,37490,that it was little mytishchi burningset on fire by mamonovs
37491,37491,cossacks
37492,37492,but look here brothers theres another fire remarked an
37493,37493,orderly
37494,37494,all turned their attention to the glow
37495,37495,"but they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by mamonovs
cossacks"
37496,37496,but thats not mytishchi its farther away
37497,37497,look it must be in moscow
37498,37498,two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and
37499,37499,sat down on its steps
37500,37500,"its more to the left why little mytishchi is over there and
this is right on the other side"
37501,37501,several men joined the first two
37502,37502,"see how its flaring said one ""thats a fire in moscow either"
37503,37503,"in the sushchevski or the rogozhski quarter"""
37504,37504,no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed
37505,37505,silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance
37506,37506,up to the group and shouted at mishka
37507,37507,"what are you staring at you goodfornothing the count will be
calling and theres nobody there go and gather the clothes together"
37508,37508,i only ran out to get some water said mishka
37509,37509,"but what do you think daniel terentich doesnt it look as if that
glow were in moscow remarked one of the footmen"
37510,37510,farther still
37511,37511,god have mercy its windy and dry said another voice
37512,37512,"just look see what its doing now o lord you can even see the
crows flying lord have mercy on us sinners"
37513,37513,theyll put it out no fear
37514,37514,and it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
37515,37515,significance for them of the glow they were watching sighs were
37516,37516,chapter xxxi
37517,37517,moscow was burning the count donned his dressing gown and went out to
37518,37518,with him only natasha and the countess remained in the room petya
37519,37519,which was making for troitsa
37520,37520,icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to
37521,37521,her fathers words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of
37522,37522,oh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled and
37523,37523,former attitude
37524,37524,but you didnt see it
37525,37525,yes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be
37526,37526,left in peace
37527,37527,moscow nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of
37528,37528,importance to natasha
37529,37529,the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess
37530,37530,went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand
37531,37531,finally kissed her
37532,37532,you are cold you are trembling all over youd better lie down
37533,37533,said the countess
37534,37534,lie down all right i will ill lie down at once said natasha
37535,37535,when natasha had been told that morning that prince andrew was
37536,37536,asked many questions where was he going how was he wounded was it
37537,37537,serious and could she see him but after she had been told that she
37538,37538,she might she would still be told the same all the way she had sat
37539,37539,and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated
37540,37540,herself on arriving she was planning something and either deciding or
37541,37541,natasha undress darling lie down on my bed
37542,37542,a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame
37543,37543,schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor
37544,37544,no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha replied
37545,37545,irritably and she went to the window and opened it through the open
37546,37546,window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she
37547,37547,slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame
37548,37548,natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince
37549,37549,andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut
37550,37550,across the passage but this dreadful incessant moaning made her
37551,37551,sob the countess exchanged a look with sonya
37552,37552,she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made
37553,37553,fixedly before her when her toilet for the night was finished she
37554,37554,sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the
37555,37555,door
37556,37556,natasha youd better lie in the middle said sonya
37557,37557,cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few
37558,37558,steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle
37559,37559,it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically
37560,37560,with alarm and terror and overflowing with love
37561,37561,she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the
37562,37562,from the moment she had been told that of prince andrews wound
37563,37563,the more convinced that it was necessary
37564,37564,all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now
37565,37565,that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
37566,37566,see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that
37567,37567,in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when
37568,37568,herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another man
37569,37569,and two othersthe doctor and a valetlay on the floor
37570,37570,"want whats the matter"" made natasha approach more swiftly to what"
37571,37571,he smiled and held out his hand to her
37572,37572,chapter xxxii
37573,37573,seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the
37574,37574,ambulance station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the
37575,37575,opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with
37576,37576,his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning
37577,37577,the first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had
37578,37578,asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his
37579,37579,removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose
37580,37580,consciousness when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a
37581,37581,long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened them and
37582,37582,"whispered softly ""and the tea"" his remembering such a small detail"
37583,37583,and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he
37584,37584,was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did
37585,37585,wounded in the leg at the battle of borodino they were accompanied by
37586,37586,with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to
37587,37587,understand and remember something
37588,37588,i dont want any more is timokhin here he asked
37589,37589,timokhin crept along the bench to him
37590,37590,i am here your excellency
37591,37591,hows your wound
37592,37592,mine sir all right but how about you
37593,37593,prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something
37594,37594,couldnt one get a book he asked
37595,37595,what book
37596,37596,the gospels i havent one
37597,37597,the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
37598,37598,was feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly
37599,37599,as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted
37600,37600,examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased
37601,37601,wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and
37602,37602,delirious from the agony he kept asking them to get him the book
37603,37603,and put it under him
37604,37604,"what trouble would it be to you he said ""i have not got one"
37605,37605,"by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under
him said the valet"
37606,37606,the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was
37607,37607,the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he
37608,37608,asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at
37609,37609,mytishchi after growing confused from pain while being carried into
37610,37610,now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to
37611,37611,do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them the
37612,37612,uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over
37613,37613,time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him
37614,37614,was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage someone was
37615,37615,shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the
37616,37616,was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom
37617,37617,power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which
37618,37618,to fix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from
37619,37619,the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in
37620,37620,and can then return again to his own thoughts but prince andrews
37621,37621,mind was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of
37622,37622,apart from his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him
37623,37623,simultaneously at times his brain suddenly began to work with a
37624,37624,unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again
37625,37625,"gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes ""a happiness"
37626,37626,possible only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was
37627,37627,"the son"""
37628,37628,andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality
37629,37629,a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
37630,37630,whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it
37631,37631,was difficult so that this airy structure should not collapse but
37632,37632,nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound
37633,37633,andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings
37634,37634,again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and
37635,37635,force
37636,37636,"yeslove he thought again quite clearly ""but not love which"
37637,37637,saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love
37638,37638,which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an
37639,37639,manifestations it is possible to love someone dear to you with
37640,37640,i experienced such joy when i felt that i loved that man what has
37641,37641,become of him is he alive

37644,37644,pitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipiti boom flopped the
37645,37645,world of reality and delirium in which something particular was
37646,37646,happening in that world some structure was still being erected and
37647,37647,door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very
37648,37648,natasha of whom he had just been thinking
37649,37649,oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince
37650,37650,remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer
37651,37651,andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his
37652,37652,natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure
37653,37653,sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it
37654,37654,something quivered
37655,37655,"you he said ""how fortunate"""
37656,37656,with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on
37657,37657,forgive me
37658,37658,i love you said prince andrew
37659,37659,forgive

37664,37664,bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench
37665,37665,like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natasha went out of the
37666,37666,not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in
37667,37667,nursing a wounded man
37668,37668,dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew
37669,37669,natasha though with the intimacy now established between the
37670,37670,wounded man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover
37671,37671,and prince andrewspoke of this the unsettled question of life and
37672,37672,out all other considerations
37673,37673,chapter xxxiii
37674,37674,the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt
37675,37675,something shameful he had done the day before that something shameful
37676,37676,was his yesterdays conversation with captain ramballe
37677,37677,remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day
37678,37678,"entry into moscow before noon"""
37679,37679,but hastened to act
37680,37680,go out but it then occurred to him for the first time that he
37681,37681,certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the
37682,37682,streets it was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his
37683,37683,wide coat he could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his
37684,37684,daughter my youngest daughter is left behind shes burned ooh
37685,37685,"was it for this i nursed you ooh"""
37686,37686,"evidently only to justify himself before the stranger ""sister must"
37687,37687,man would have rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and
37688,37688,rushed to collect our things we ran out just as we were this is
37689,37689,rest is lost we seized the children but not katie ooh o
37690,37690,but where was she left asked pierre
37691,37691,from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
37692,37692,might help her
37693,37693,still farther exposing her long teeth
37694,37694,show me the way show me i ill do it gasped pierre rapidly
37695,37695,felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his
37696,37696,povarskoy the whole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues
37697,37697,of flame here and there broke through that cloud a great number of
37698,37698,people crowded in front of the conflagration in the middle of the
37699,37699,street stood a french general saying something to those around him
37700,37700,on ne passe pas cried a voice
37701,37701,"""you cant pass"
37702,37702,"this way uncle cried the girl ""well pass through the side"
37703,37703,issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof
37704,37704,and involuntarily stopped
37705,37705,which is it which is your house he asked
37706,37706,the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings
37707,37707,involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
37708,37708,around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not
37709,37709,but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber
37710,37710,and there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish
37711,37711,of a conflagration it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because
37712,37712,at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas
37713,37713,resolute he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to
37714,37714,his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound
37715,37715,and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him
37716,37716,pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some
37717,37717,metal articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the
37718,37718,drawer
37719,37719,what does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to
37720,37720,pierre
37721,37721,theres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried
37722,37722,pierre
37723,37723,threateningly toward him
37724,37724,"a child shouted a frenchman from above ""i did hear something"
37725,37725,squealing in the garden perhaps its his brat that the fellow is
37726,37726,where is it where said pierre
37727,37727,"garden at the back of the house ""wait a bitim coming down"""
37728,37728,him into the garden
37729,37729,"hurry up you others he called out to his comrades ""its getting"
37730,37730,"hot"""
37731,37731,when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman
37732,37732,where a threeyearold girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat
37733,37733,there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the
37734,37734,"know"" and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his"
37735,37735,comrades
37736,37736,arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little
37737,37737,hands to pull pierres hands away and to bite them with her slobbering
37738,37738,mouth pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he
37739,37739,had experienced when touching some nasty little animal but he made an
37740,37740,effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large
37741,37741,himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden
37742,37742,seeking another way out
37743,37743,chapter xxxiv
37744,37744,with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the
37745,37745,povarskoy he did not at first recognize the place from which he had
37746,37746,goods that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian
37747,37747,families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their
37748,37748,clothing pierre took no notice of them he hurried to find the family
37749,37749,of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother
37750,37750,and go to save someone else pierre felt that he had still much to
37751,37751,little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a slight
37752,37752,smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
37753,37753,he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left
37754,37754,faces he met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family
37755,37755,out onto the snow she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the
37756,37756,was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it her face struck
37757,37757,with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous
37758,37758,about him
37759,37759,"have you lost anyone my dear fellow youre of the gentry
yourself arent you whose child is it they asked him"
37760,37760,pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat
37761,37761,whether anyone knew where she had gone
37762,37762,in his customary bass
37763,37763,"the anferovs no said the woman ""they left in the morning"
37764,37764,"that must be either mary nikolievnas or the ivanovs"""
37765,37765,he says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a house
37766,37766,serf
37767,37767,do you know her shes thin with long teeth said pierre
37768,37768,o lord have mercy added the deacon
37769,37769,but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds
37770,37770,been intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was
37771,37771,looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone
37772,37772,tied round the waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and
37773,37773,his movements and with an idiotic expression of face he wore a
37774,37774,boots the little barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the
37775,37775,legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots the other in
37776,37776,the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and
37777,37777,silent
37778,37778,here take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to
37779,37779,armenian family
37780,37780,the old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman had
37781,37781,secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other
37782,37782,from his pockets had seized her by the neck
37783,37783,the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same
37784,37784,feel what the soldier was doing to her
37785,37785,while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
37786,37786,let that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious
37787,37787,aside
37788,37788,pierre
37789,37789,voyons pas de betises he cried
37790,37790,pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing
37791,37791,and his strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted
37792,37792,him off his feet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval
37793,37793,patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans
37794,37794,came up at a trot to pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them
37795,37795,pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that he only
37796,37796,remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that
37797,37797,his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood
37798,37798,around him and were searching him
37799,37799,lieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre
37800,37800,understood
37801,37801,ah a weapon said the officer and turned to the barefooted
37802,37802,"all about it at the courtmartial"" then he turned to pierre ""do"
37803,37803,"you speak french"""
37804,37804,pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply
37805,37805,in a whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves
37806,37806,on both sides of pierre
37807,37807,"distance from pierre ""call the interpreter"""
37808,37808,and by his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to
37809,37809,be a french salesman from one of the moscow shops
37810,37810,a searching look at pierre
37811,37811,ah he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the officer
37812,37812,and ask him who he is he added
37813,37813,"who are you asked the interpreter in poor russian ""you must"
37814,37814,"answer the chief"""
37815,37815,i will not tell you who i am i am your prisonertake me
37816,37816,pierre suddenly replied in french
37817,37817,a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood
37818,37818,started she moved forward
37819,37819,"where are they taking you to you poor dear said she ""and the"
37820,37820,"theirs"" said the woman"
37821,37821,what does that woman want asked the officer
37822,37822,pierre was as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight
37823,37823,of the little girl he had saved
37824,37824,"what does she want he murmured ""she is bringing me my daughter"
37825,37825,with resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers
37826,37826,the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various
37827,37827,opinion which had that day originated among the higher french
37828,37828,a number of streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects

37835,37835,interests and service interests and intrigues as usual only in the
37836,37836,very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the
37837,37837,difficulties of the actual position stories were whispered of how

37844,37844,sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was
37845,37845,read at the empress the art of his reading was supposed to lie in

37847,37847,expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of
37848,37848,their visits to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic
37849,37849,let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
37850,37850,conversation
37851,37851,the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess
37852,37852,petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to
37853,37853,some italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way
37854,37854,they all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness
37855,37855,arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at
37856,37856,such inconvenience but in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to
37857,37857,think of this or even appear to know it
37858,37858,"they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is
angina pectoris"
37859,37859,angina oh thats a terrible illness
37860,37860,they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina
37861,37861,and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction
37862,37862,"the count is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the
doctor told him the case was dangerous"
37863,37863,oh it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman
37864,37864,"deserves she is very unfortunate"" added anna pavlovna"
37865,37865,supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the
37866,37866,ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been
37867,37867,called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan
37868,37868,who might employ dangerous remedies
37869,37869,your information maybe better than mine anna pavlovna suddenly

37890,37890,anyone had anything to say to the contrary but no one said
37891,37891,"her christ""he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her""as a mother"
37892,37892,prince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice

37897,37897,what force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader
37898,37898,and of author
37899,37899,animated by that address anna pavlovnas guests talked for a long
37900,37900,time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as
37901,37901,to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days
37902,37902,chapter ii
37903,37903,anna pavlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day
37904,37904,during the service at the palace church in honor of the emperors

37908,37908,joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the
37909,37909,ruler for france
37910,37910,it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real
37911,37911,strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far
37912,37912,from the scene of action general events involuntarily group
37913,37913,themselves around some particular incident so now the courtiers
37914,37914,pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on
37915,37915,the emperors birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it was
37916,37916,like a successfully arranged surprise mention was made in kutuzovs
37917,37917,side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single
37918,37918,and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the
37919,37919,words
37920,37920,"what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a
loss kutaysov is how sorry i am"
37921,37921,what did i tell about kutuzov prince vasili now said with a
37922,37922,"prophets pride ""i always said he was the only man capable of"
37923,37923,"defeating napoleon"""
37924,37924,but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood
37925,37925,grew anxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the
37926,37926,suspense occasioned the emperor
37927,37927,him as the cause of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasili no
37928,37928,a terrible piece of news was added countess helene bezukhova had
37929,37929,suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to
37930,37930,but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private
37931,37931,physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a
37932,37932,the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom
37933,37933,agony before assistance could be rendered her it was said that prince
37934,37934,had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they
37935,37935,had immediately let the matter drop
37936,37936,talk in general centered round three melancholy facts the emperors
37937,37937,on the third day after kutuzovs report a country gentleman
37938,37938,spread through the whole town this was terrible what a position
37939,37939,during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his
37940,37940,was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old
37941,37941,man
37942,37942,"i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted
to such a man"
37943,37943,as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt
37944,37944,count rostopchin
37945,37945,prince kutuzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he
37946,37946,demands police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road he
37947,37947,writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow sire kutuzovs

37952,37952,on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to
37953,37953,kutuzov with the following rescript
37954,37954,prince michael ilarionovich since the twentyninth of august i have
37955,37955,silence increases my astonishment i am sending this by

37959,37959,kutuzov reached petersburg with the official announcement of that
37960,37960,said of himself
37961,37961,the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the
37962,37962,he wrote when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain

37966,37966,though the source of m michauds chagrin must have been different
37967,37967,shown into the emperors study that the latter at once asked
37968,37968,have you brought me sad news colonel
37969,37969,the abandonment of moscow
37970,37970,have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked

37974,37974,yes sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in flames
37975,37975,was frightened by what he had done
37976,37976,a firm voice
37977,37977,"i see colonel from all that is happening that providence
requires great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in
all things to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the
army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did
you not notice discouragement"
37978,37978,direct and relevant question which required a direct answer
37979,37979,"sire will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal
soldier he asked to gain time"
37980,37980,"colonel i always require it replied the emperor ""conceal"
37981,37981,"exception in desperate and agonized terror"""
37982,37982,"misfortune make my russians lose heart never"""
37983,37983,michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
37984,37984,prepared
37985,37985,allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace they are burning for the
37986,37986,prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they
37987,37987,"are"""
37988,37988,"colonel"""
37989,37989,he bent his head and was silent for some time
37990,37990,his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic
37991,37991,go that when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the
37992,37992,head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last

37995,37995,"and of my beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate"""
37996,37996,having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly
37997,37997,turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his
37998,37998,elbow with a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face
37999,37999,was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger
38000,38000,"colonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we
may recall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the"
38001,38001,when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm
38002,38002,de coeur et dameat that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by

38005,38005,with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him
38006,38006,chapter iv
38007,38007,it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine
38008,38008,that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were
38009,38009,descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the
38010,38010,the russians but it was not really so it appears so to us because we
38011,38011,see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all
38012,38012,the personal human interests that people had yet in reality those
38013,38013,personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general
38014,38014,interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt
38015,38015,or even noticed most of the people at that time paid no attention
38016,38016,to the general progress of events but were guided only by their
38017,38017,that period were most useful
38018,38018,those who tried to understand the general course of events and to
38019,38019,take part in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless
38020,38020,did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolishlike
38021,38021,involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of
38022,38022,pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed
38023,38023,against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty
38024,38024,of in historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of
38025,38025,the tree of knowledge is specially applicable only unconscious action
38026,38026,understands its significance if he tries to realize it his efforts
38027,38027,are fruitless
38028,38028,the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place
38029,38029,in russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg
38030,38030,and talked of selfsacrifice and so on but in the army which
38031,38031,and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be
38032,38032,at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally
38033,38033,racking his brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the
38034,38034,but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their
38035,38035,and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of
38036,38036,a regiment in a couple of years time
38037,38037,with the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which his
38038,38038,comrades fully understood
38039,38039,continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warcan understand
38040,38040,the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by
38041,38041,for the first time what for a long while specially surprised and
38042,38042,flattered that a passing officer should joke with them
38043,38043,in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in
38044,38044,who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he
38045,38045,received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically
38046,38046,considering the general progress of affairs and approving and
38047,38047,disapproving with full right to do so nicholas was in such good
38048,38048,spirits that this merely amused him
38049,38049,from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor the
38050,38050,to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out
38051,38051,way
38052,38052,of him
38053,38053,seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay
38054,38054,in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
38055,38055,to be in time for the governors party
38056,38056,"the phrase ""better late than never"" on his lips"
38057,38057,that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the
38058,38058,as to a ball
38059,38059,that went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was
38060,38060,the society gathered together at the governors was the best in
38061,38061,voronezh
38062,38062,there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow
38063,38063,an officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence
38064,38064,of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the
38065,38065,treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint
38066,38066,"words ""better late than never"" and heard them repeated several times"
38067,38067,felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the
38068,38068,and intoxicatingly so after his long privations at posting
38069,38069,there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of
38070,38070,daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these was the
38071,38071,"called him ""nicholas"""
38072,38072,dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the
38073,38073,provincial society by his agility his particularly free manner of
38074,38074,dancing even surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised
38075,38075,at the way he danced that evening he had never danced like that in
38076,38076,moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner
38077,38077,accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the
38078,38078,provinces
38079,38079,with the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other
38080,38080,to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but
38081,38081,the latters goodnatured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even
38082,38082,he involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of
38083,38083,though there were but a given amount of animation between them and
38084,38084,as the wifes share increased the husbands diminished

38087,38087,with a smile that never left his face jauntily shifting the
38088,38088,blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in
38089,38089,voronezh
38090,38090,which lady
38091,38091,a charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at his
38092,38092,"at her shoulders ""like dianas"""
38093,38093,the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
38094,38094,about
38095,38095,his intention to elope with a blonde lady
38096,38096,goodnatured wife came up with a look of disapproval
38097,38097,pronouncing the name so that nicholas at once understood that anna
38098,38098,"you let me call you so"""
38099,38099,oh yes aunt who is she
38100,38100,"anna ignatyevna malvintseva she has heard from her niece how you
rescued her can you guess"
38101,38101,i rescued such a lot of them said nicholas
38102,38102,"her niece princess bolkonskaya she is here in voronezh with her
aunt oho how you blush why are"
38103,38103,not a bit please dont aunt
38104,38104,very well very well oh what a fellow you are
38105,38105,the governors wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady
38106,38106,always lived in voronezh when rostov approached her she was
38107,38107,her
38108,38108,"nicholas ""pray come and see me"""
38109,38109,important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation
38110,38110,to come to see her
38111,38111,nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the
38112,38112,mention of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and
38113,38113,when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the
38114,38114,so as not to be in her way
38115,38115,do you know dear boy began the governors wife with a serious
38116,38116,"for you would you like me to arrange it"""
38117,38117,whom do you mean aunt asked nicholas
38118,38118,"i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovna
speaks of lily but i say nothe princess do you want me to do
it i am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl
she is really and she is not at all so plain either"
38119,38119,"not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea ""as"
38120,38120,of course not
38121,38121,oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the
38122,38122,simplicity of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so
38123,38123,pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else
38124,38124,but what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife
38125,38125,"thought nicholas suddenly at supper ""she will really begin to arrange"
38126,38126,"a match and soyna"" and on taking leave of the governors"
38127,38127,he drew her aside
38128,38128,but see here to tell the truth aunt
38129,38129,what is it my dear come lets sit down here said she
38130,38130,nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
38131,38131,his friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he
38132,38132,afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable
38133,38133,himas it seems to everyone in such casesthat it was merely some
38134,38134,his family
38135,38135,"you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but
the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me"
38136,38136,oh yes i understand said the governors wife
38137,38137,"but princess bolkonskayathats another matter i will tell you
the truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to
her and then after i met her under such circumstancesso strangely
the idea often occurred to me this is fate especially if you
remember that mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never
happened to meet her before somehow it had always happened that we
did not meet and as long as my sister natasha was engaged to her
brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of
marrying her and it must needs happen that i should meet her just
when natashas engagement had been broken off and then
everything so you see i never told this to anyone and never
will only to you"
38138,38138,the governors wife pressed his elbow gratefully
38139,38139,"you know sonya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her
and will do so so you see there can be no question about said"
38140,38140,nicholas incoherently and blushing
38141,38141,"my dear boy what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing
and you yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and
what about your mother it would kill her thats one thing and
what sort of life would it be for sonyaif shes a girl with a heart
your mother in despair and you all ruined no my dear you and
sonya ought to understand that"
38142,38142,nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments
38143,38143,"but you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there
is always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife"
38144,38144,plump little hand

38146,38146,andrew giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at
38147,38147,voronezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her
38148,38148,deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with
38149,38149,the ruin of russia she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the
38150,38150,her nephews education for which she had always felt herself
38151,38151,peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal
38152,38152,dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her
38153,38153,and were related to her meeting with rostov
38154,38154,the day after her party the governors wife came to see
38155,38155,brought together and could get to know one another malvintseva
38156,38156,princess marys name was mentioned but princess mary experienced a
38157,38157,painful rather than a joyful feelingher mental tranquillity was
38158,38158,continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she
38159,38159,decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her
38160,38160,receive visitors then she thought this would be rude after what he
38161,38161,had done for her then it occurred to her that her aunt and the
38162,38162,governors wife had intentions concerning herself and rostovtheir
38163,38163,looks and words at times seemed to confirm this suppositionthen
38164,38164,her and to her fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see
38165,38165,and then to mean too much more than anything she feared lest the
38166,38166,confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she
38167,38167,saw him
38168,38168,but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
38169,38169,only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
38170,38170,and radiant light
38171,38171,to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural
38172,38172,just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look
38173,38173,with shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she
38174,38174,meeting a man she wished to attract
38175,38175,"either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has
greatly improved without my having noticed it and above all what
tact and grace thought mademoiselle bourienne"
38176,38176,would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the
38177,38177,change that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized
38178,38178,compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will from the
38179,38179,if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the
38180,38180,rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he
38181,38181,their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of
38182,38182,about it they spoke of their last meetingnicholas trying to
38183,38183,soon as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of
38184,38184,too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of
38185,38185,confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and
38186,38186,extraordinary being nicholas blushed and was confused when people
38187,38187,spoke to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and
38188,38188,caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he
38189,38189,boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved nicholas also
38190,38190,and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness
38191,38191,and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but
38192,38192,on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and
38193,38193,for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at
38194,38194,the bishops house before mass
38195,38195,though rostov told the governeors wife that he would not make any
38196,38196,as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what
38197,38197,sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own
38198,38198,chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly
38199,38199,carrying him he knew not where he knew that after his promise to
38200,38200,sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to
38201,38201,princess mary and he knew that he would never act basely but he also
38202,38202,knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart that by resigning
38203,38203,himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were
38204,38204,something very importantmore important than anything he had ever
38205,38205,done in his life
38206,38206,him and he often thought about her but he never thought about her
38207,38207,as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he
38208,38208,afraid
38209,38209,chapter vii
38210,38210,learned of her brothers wound only from the gazette and having no
38211,38211,again himself to set off in search of prince andrew
38212,38212,when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the
38213,38213,he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the
38214,38214,conversations he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to
38215,38215,judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would
38216,38216,everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying
38217,38217,squadron quartermaster
38218,38218,victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with
38219,38219,subjects when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him
38220,38220,to her
38221,38221,the choir
38222,38222,nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the
38223,38223,time before leaving the church
38224,38224,nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he
38225,38225,without waiting to be prompted by the governors wife and not asking
38226,38226,himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here
38227,38227,with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow
38228,38228,there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov
38229,38229,"it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not
living it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he
is a colonel"
38230,38230,cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face
38231,38231,and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette
38232,38232,"said it was a shell ""either proving fatal at once or being very"
38233,38233,"sure"""
38234,38234,princess mary interrupted him
38235,38235,some accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that
38236,38236,business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to
38237,38237,princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had
38238,38238,met her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such
38239,38239,when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was
38240,38240,not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the
38241,38241,regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her
38242,38242,the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated
38243,38243,him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the
38244,38244,expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like
38245,38245,prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
38246,38246,the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an
38247,38247,irresistible attraction
38248,38248,she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself
38249,38249,why am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and he
38250,38250,involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one
38251,38251,and the abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked
38252,38252,and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would
38253,38253,happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she would
38254,38254,and no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago
38255,38255,simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all
38256,38256,but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little
38257,38257,frightening
38258,38258,"how she prayed he thought ""it was plain that her whole soul"
38259,38259,and i am sure her prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i
38260,38260,into sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had
38261,38261,"from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice ""a courier"
38262,38262,"has arrived and theres a letter for you"""
38263,38263,well all right thanks you can go
38264,38264,and the other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and
38265,38265,opened sonyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale
38266,38266,and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy
38267,38267,no its not possible he cried aloud
38268,38268,unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter
38269,38269,his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that
38270,38270,god would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much
38271,38271,as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had
38272,38272,coincidence
38273,38273,letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from
38274,38274,which there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last
38275,38275,unfortunate eventsthe loss of almost the whole of the rostovs
38276,38276,moscow propertyand the countess repeatedly expressed wish that
38277,38277,release him from his promise and set him completely free
38278,38278,it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of
38279,38279,sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me she
38280,38280,your sonya
38281,38281,countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded
38282,38282,said there was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him
38283,38283,next day nicholas took his mothers letter and went to see
38284,38284,"princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what ""natasha"
38285,38285,became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations
38286,38286,the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to
38287,38287,chapter viii
38288,38288,nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more
38289,38289,and more she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this
38290,38290,nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the
38291,38291,countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions
38292,38292,to sonya
38293,38293,and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
38294,38294,engagement with nicholas
38295,38295,i shall not be at peace till you promise me this
38296,38296,sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs
38297,38297,no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was
38298,38298,demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had
38299,38299,reared and brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was sonyas
38300,38300,habit her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could
38301,38301,but in all her former acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily
38302,38302,conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of
38303,38303,than anything in the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the
38304,38304,very thing that constituted the whole reward for her selfsacrifice
38305,38305,and the whole meaning of her life and for the first time she felt
38306,38306,bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to
38307,38307,torture her the more painfully she felt jealous of natasha who had
38308,38308,beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of
38309,38309,on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever
38310,38310,the bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled
38311,38311,the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find
38312,38312,escape from them in practical activity but when she heard of prince
38313,38313,god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that
38314,38314,natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love
38315,38315,him she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible
38316,38316,nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would
38317,38317,be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror
38318,38318,of what had happened during those last days and during the first
38319,38319,her personal affairs cheered sonya
38320,38320,at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a
38321,38321,whole day
38322,38322,one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much
38323,38323,better that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat
38324,38324,calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery
38325,38325,and natasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices
38326,38326,and took her hand
38327,38327,natasha what are you about come here said the countess
38328,38328,pray for aid to god and his saint
38329,38329,and went with her into the unoccupied room
38330,38330,"lives he cannot because because of"" and natasha burst into"
38331,38331,tears
38332,38332,"yes i knew it thank god murmured sonya ""he will live"""
38333,38333,sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and
38334,38334,grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one
38335,38335,friends went together to prince andrews door natasha opened it
38336,38336,halfopen door
38337,38337,prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale

38339,38339,companions arm and stepping back from the door
38340,38340,what what is it asked natasha
38341,38341,lips
38342,38342,not yet understanding what the latter was telling her
38343,38343,you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened
38344,38344,"expression ""you remember when i looked in the mirror for you at"
38345,38345,"otradnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw"""
38346,38346,recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom
38347,38347,she had seen lying down
38348,38348,extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction
38349,38349,but what does it mean she added meditatively
38350,38350,at her head
38351,38351,window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred
38352,38352,the countess was writing to her son
38353,38353,spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these
38354,38354,refusal
38355,38355,yes mamma i will write said she
38356,38356,of her vision now that she knew that the renewal of natashas
38357,38357,relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying
38358,38358,selfsacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and
38359,38359,loved to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a
38360,38360,magnanimous deedinterrupted several times by the tears that dimmed
38361,38361,her velvety black eyesshe wrote that touching letter the arrival
38362,38362,of which had so amazed nicholas
38363,38363,chapter ix
38364,38364,the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with
38365,38365,taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both
38366,38366,uncertainty as to who he might beperhaps a very important person
38367,38367,and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him
38368,38368,the new guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as
38369,38369,he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day
38370,38370,vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and
38371,38371,the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child
38372,38372,detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they
38373,38373,separate room he had occupied was required by an officer
38374,38374,all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class
38375,38375,especially as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them
38376,38376,making fun of him
38377,38377,among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was
38378,38378,taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white
38379,38379,mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on
38380,38380,their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in
38381,38381,through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow
38382,38382,to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was
38383,38383,only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of
38384,38384,and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would
38385,38385,pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to
38386,38386,its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought
38387,38387,point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had
38388,38388,seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in
38389,38389,moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was
38390,38390,he replied that he could not answer it
38391,38391,put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the
38392,38392,general with the white mustache and red flushed face
38393,38393,on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart
38394,38394,pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a
38395,38395,merchants house near the crimean bridge on his way through the
38396,38396,streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the
38397,38397,whole city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize
38398,38398,with horror
38399,38399,he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and
38400,38400,all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any
38401,38401,"from the soldiers evidently for them ""the marshal"" represented a very"
38402,38402,high and rather mysterious power
38403,38403,all for pierre
38404,38404,chapter x
38405,38405,on the eighth of september an officera very important one
38406,38406,judging by the respect the guards showed himentered the coach
38407,38407,the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up
38408,38408,before taking them to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers
38409,38409,arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the virgins field
38410,38410,the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken
38411,38411,charred ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves
38412,38412,walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not
38413,38413,recognize districts he had known well here and there he could see
38414,38414,belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin
38415,38415,glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly
38416,38416,these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the
38417,38417,nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate
38418,38418,be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when
38419,38419,they saw the french
38420,38420,had been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the
38421,38421,looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by
38422,38422,and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french
38423,38423,officer had read out when he came that morning pierre had been
38424,38424,taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to
38425,38425,answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his
38426,38426,pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to
38427,38427,felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did
38428,38428,not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at
38429,38429,dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had
38430,38430,calculated to frighten pierre
38431,38431,the chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his
38432,38432,head as in a vise
38433,38433,you cannot know me general i have never seen you
38434,38434,davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice
38435,38435,pierre rapidly began
38436,38436,"officer and have not quitted moscow"""
38437,38437,your name asked davout
38438,38438,bezukhov
38439,38439,what proof have i that you are not lying
38440,38440,pleading voice
38441,38441,davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they
38442,38442,between the two men at that moment an immense number of things passed
38443,38443,both children of humanity and were brothers
38444,38444,human being he reflected for a moment
38445,38445,how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout
38446,38446,coldly
38447,38447,street where the house was
38448,38448,you are not what you say returned davout
38449,38449,the truth of his statements
38450,38450,but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to
38451,38451,davout
38452,38452,buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten
38453,38453,pierre
38454,38454,in pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but
38455,38455,where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach
38456,38456,house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to
38457,38457,him as they crossed the virgins field
38458,38458,he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
38459,38459,question to davout
38460,38460,pierre did not know
38461,38461,as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only
38462,38462,thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really
38463,38463,sentenced him to death not the men on the commission that had first
38464,38464,just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the
38465,38465,felt that it was no one
38466,38466,it was a systema concurrence of circumstances
38467,38467,a system of some sort was killing himpierredepriving him of
38468,38468,chapter xi
38469,38469,from prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down
38470,38470,garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit
38471,38471,crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and
38472,38472,the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red
38473,38473,epaulets and high boots and shakos
38474,38474,felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of
38475,38475,thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only
38476,38476,one wishthat the frightful thing that had to happen should happen
38477,38477,quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized
38478,38478,them
38479,38479,the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and
38480,38480,in a loose coat
38481,38481,pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them
38482,38482,"this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who"" flashed"
38483,38483,for an instant through his mind
38484,38484,sharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifth
38485,38485,the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment
38486,38486,they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at
38487,38487,pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was
38488,38488,suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming
38489,38489,was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill
38490,38490,him with glittering eyes
38491,38491,pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his
38492,38492,highest pitch at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man
38493,38493,seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare
38494,38494,foot with the other
38495,38495,when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot
38496,38496,which hurt the back of his head then when they propped him against
38497,38497,back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and
38498,38498,did not miss his slightest movement
38499,38499,probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports
38500,38500,of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards
38501,38501,remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw
38502,38502,hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the
38503,38503,something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a
38504,38504,thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed
38505,38505,the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it
38506,38506,into the pit
38507,38507,they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who
38508,38508,must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible
38509,38509,pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying
38510,38510,with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the
38511,38511,but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole
38512,38512,angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and
38513,38513,when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was
38514,38514,post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the
38515,38515,by
38516,38516,pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
38517,38517,couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies
38518,38518,taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an
38519,38519,the elbow dragged him to his company the crowd of russians and
38520,38520,frenchmen began to disperse they all went away silently and with
38521,38521,drooping heads
38522,38522,that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen
38523,38523,pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier
38524,38524,not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he
38525,38525,made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away
38526,38526,chapter xii
38527,38527,after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the
38528,38528,toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers
38529,38529,and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the
38530,38530,barracks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said
38531,38531,darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at
38532,38532,the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or
38533,38533,they all seemed to him equally meaningless
38534,38534,from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders
38535,38535,had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not
38536,38536,felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be
38537,38537,found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled
38538,38538,any fault of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain
38539,38539,faith in the meaning of life
38540,38540,around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
38541,38541,about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and
38542,38542,found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing
38543,38543,and talking on all sides
38544,38544,well then mates that very prince who some voice at the
38545,38545,who
38546,38546,pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon
38547,38547,as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
38548,38548,ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of
38549,38549,opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around
38550,38550,him
38551,38551,beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose
38552,38552,presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration
38553,38553,which came from him every time he moved this man was doing
38554,38554,his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing
38555,38555,used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg
38556,38556,glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the
38557,38557,having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his
38558,38558,bands up on some pegs fixed above his head then he took out a
38559,38559,his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was
38560,38560,taking his eyes from him
38561,38561,youve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly
38562,38562,said
38563,38563,and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong
38564,38564,tones
38565,38565,wrapped in a rag
38566,38566,"as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes ""we had soup"
38567,38567,"for dinner and the potatoes are grand"""
38568,38568,pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
38569,38569,extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat
38570,38570,"well are they all right said the soldier with a smile ""you"
38571,38571,"should do like this"""
38572,38572,"the potatoes are grand he said once more ""eat some like that"""
38573,38573,pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better
38574,38574,"fellows the last one was hardly twenty"""
38575,38575,"you stayed in moscow"""
38576,38576,i didnt think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally
38577,38577,replied pierre
38578,38578,and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house
38579,38579,"no i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and
tried me as an incendiary"
38580,38580,where theres law theres injustice put in the little man
38581,38581,and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the last
38582,38582,of the potato
38583,38583,i it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow
38584,38584,why are you a soldier then
38585,38585,"yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of
fever we werent told anything there were some twenty of us lying
there we had no idea never guessed at all"
38586,38586,and do you feel sad here pierre inquired
38587,38587,"address him ""they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one"
38588,38588,to help feeling sad moscowshes the mother of cities how can one
38589,38589,"who i said karataev ""i say things happen not as we plan but"
38590,38590,"they still living"" he asked"
38591,38591,suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put
38592,38592,especially that he had no mother
38593,38593,"ones"" he went on asking"
38594,38594,hastened to add
38595,38595,"never mind youre young folks yet and please god may still have
some the great thing is to live in harmony"
38596,38596,but its all the same now pierre could not help saying
38597,38597,"or a beggars sack"""
38598,38598,preparing to tell a long story
38599,38599,"well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began ""we"
38600,38600,our house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing
38601,38601,there were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so
38602,38602,"happened"""
38603,38603,and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into
38604,38604,"well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice ""we thought"
38605,38605,it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been
38606,38606,see that they are living better than before the yard full of
38607,38607,the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if
38608,38608,not wellthats not right our luck is like water in a dragnet
38609,38609,"thats how it is"""
38610,38610,and platon shifted his seat on the straw
38611,38611,after a short silence he rose
38612,38612,crossing himself and repeating
38613,38613,"saying i was praying dont you pray"""
38614,38614,"yes i do said pierre ""but what was that you said frola and"
38615,38615,"lavra"""
38616,38616,immediately
38617,38617,sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
38618,38618,that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a
38619,38619,new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations
38620,38620,chapter xiii
38621,38621,confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he
38622,38622,remained for four weeks
38623,38623,when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures
38624,38624,most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything
38625,38625,was fully confirmed platons whole figurein a french overcoat
38626,38626,himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his
38627,38627,body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and
38628,38628,endurance
38629,38629,peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it
38630,38630,was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going
38631,38631,had an irresistible persuasiveness
38632,38632,his physical strength and agility during the first days of his
38633,38633,imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
38634,38634,"me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf"" and every morning on"
38635,38635,which he was fondand songs he did not sing like a trained singer
38636,38636,to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks
38637,38637,such times was very serious
38638,38638,seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him
38639,38639,everything military and alien to himselfand had returned to his
38640,38640,former peasant habits
38641,38641,a soldier on leavea shirt outside breeches he would say
38642,38642,during the whole of his army service when he related anything it
38643,38643,was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his
38644,38644,suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom
38645,38645,he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a
38646,38646,charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest eventssometimes
38647,38647,just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them
38648,38648,assumed in karataevs a character of solemn fitness he liked to
38649,38649,hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening
38650,38650,stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such
38651,38651,the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no
38652,38652,loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in
38653,38653,of karataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which he
38654,38654,unconsciously gave pierres spiritual life its due he would not
38655,38655,have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to
38656,38656,feel in the same way toward karataev
38657,38657,to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary
38658,38658,his excellency is staying in the same house with them
38659,38659,how is he
38660,38660,the servants say he is still the same
38661,38661,they were let down
38662,38662,the carriage door was opened on the left there was watera great
38663,38663,riverand on the right a porch there were people at the entrance
38664,38664,it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this
38665,38665,rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she
38666,38666,embraced princess mary and kissed her
38667,38667,"longtemps"""
38668,38668,"""my child i love you and have known you a long time"""

38674,38674,"what a lovely boy"""
38675,38675,was talking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the
38676,38676,changed very much since princess mary had last seen him then he had
38677,38677,bewildered person while talking to princess mary he continually
38678,38678,looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right
38679,38679,of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own
38680,38680,significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in
38681,38681,life
38682,38682,and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him
38683,38683,they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her
38684,38684,was hard for her she was not vexed with these people
38685,38685,felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so
38686,38686,far from what was in her own heart
38687,38687,we have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess
38688,38688,tears of vexation showed themselves in princess marys eyes she
38689,38689,turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to
38690,38690,almost runningthat natasha whom she had liked so little at their
38691,38691,meeting in moscow long since
38692,38692,but hardly had the princess looked at natashas face before she
38693,38693,shoulder
38694,38694,hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to
38695,38695,princess mary
38696,38696,there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into
38697,38697,them it was plain that at that moment there was in natashas heart no
38698,38698,thought of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew

38704,38704,natashas face eyes would have to tell her all more clearly
38705,38705,and profoundly
38706,38706,say all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous
38707,38707,covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs
38708,38708,princess mary understood
38709,38709,but how is his wound what is his general condition
38710,38710,you you will see was all natasha could say
38711,38711,they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had
38712,38712,left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces
38713,38713,"how has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse
when did this happen princess mary inquired"
38714,38714,natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his

38716,38716,had also passed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to
38717,38717,fester natasha knew all about such things as festering and the
38718,38718,doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course then

38726,38726,"days ago this suddenly happened"" she understood those words to mean"
38727,38727,that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness
38728,38728,were signs of approaching death as she stepped to the door she
38729,38729,already saw in imagination andrews face as she remembered it in
38730,38730,and which therefore affected her very strongly she was sure he
38731,38731,would burst into sobs in his presence yet sooner or later it had to
38732,38732,as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her
38733,38733,face and met his gaze
38734,38734,fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them as they entered
38735,38735,on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess marys pace

38743,38743,voice as calm and aloof as his look

38745,38745,quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember
38746,38746,was saying

38750,38750,terrible in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he
38751,38751,understand anything living but it was obvious that he failed to

38780,38780,same cold expression
38781,38781,at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father
38782,38782,with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things
38783,38783,from their point of view
38784,38784,"yes to them it must seem sad he thought ""but how simple it is"
38785,38785,"the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father
feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess"
38786,38786,they cant understand that all those feelings they prize soall our
38787,38787,"what of it so much the better"""
38788,38788,particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more
38789,38789,bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy
38790,38790,his mind recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had
38791,38791,tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive and he dared
38792,38792,not inquire
38793,38793,and so it was in sonyas place sat natasha who had just come in
38794,38794,noiselessly
38795,38795,this physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an
38796,38796,since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick
38797,38797,something soothing in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked
38798,38798,the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact
38799,38799,he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
38800,38800,cautiously
38801,38801,told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound
38802,38802,of the future
38803,38803,can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and
38804,38804,"listened to the light click of the steel needles ""can fate have"
38805,38805,brought me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible
38806,38806,that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that
38807,38807,i have spent my life in falsity i love her more than anything in
38808,38808,him and bent over him
38809,38809,you are not asleep
38810,38810,"no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in
no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do
that light i want to weep for joy"
38811,38811,natasha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy
38812,38812,natasha i love you too much more than anything in the world
38813,38813,"and ishe turned away for an instant ""why too much"" she asked"
38814,38814,"why too much well what do you what do you feel in your
soul your whole soulshall i live what do you think"
38815,38815,his hands with a passionate movement
38816,38816,he remained silent awhile
38817,38817,how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it
38818,38818,would not do and that he had to be quiet
38819,38819,"sleep please"""
38820,38820,and sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked
38821,38821,her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished
38822,38822,soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep
38823,38823,long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration
38824,38824,as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
38825,38825,death he felt himself nearer to it
38826,38826,love what is love he thought
38827,38827,"love hinders death love is life all everything that i
understand i understand only because i love everything is
everything exists only because i love everything is united by it
alone love is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall
return to the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to"
38828,38828,him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking
38829,38829,brainspun and there was the former agitation and obscurity he
38830,38830,fell asleep
38831,38831,insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and
38832,38832,discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere
38833,38833,prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
38834,38834,all else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything
38835,38835,would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all
38836,38836,his powers he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was
38837,38837,the fear of death it stood behind the door but just when he was
38838,38838,other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in
38839,38839,backto lock it was no longer possiblebut his efforts were weak and
38840,38840,closed again
38841,38841,once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts
38842,38842,were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it
38843,38843,awoke
38844,38844,"yes it was death i diedand woke up yes death is an
awakening and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil"
38845,38845,that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual
38846,38846,vision he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been
38847,38847,natasha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer
38848,38848,that was what had happened to him two days before princess marys
38849,38849,were more convincing
38850,38850,from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew
38851,38851,together with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration
38852,38852,of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep
38853,38853,compared to the duration of a dream
38854,38854,there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
38855,38855,awakening
38856,38856,his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both
38857,38857,did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves
38858,38858,had left them but on what reminded them most closely of himhis
38859,38859,body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of
38860,38860,death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment
38861,38861,nor did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they
38862,38862,could not express in words what they understood
38863,38863,and that it was right
38864,38864,mary and natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was
38865,38865,he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there
38866,38866,was anything else he should do
38867,38867,is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes
38868,38868,himhis body
38869,38869,where has he gone where is he now
38870,38870,everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept
38871,38871,little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful
38872,38872,perplexity the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and
38873,38873,because he was no more the old count cried because he felt that
38874,38874,own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion
38875,38875,which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of
38876,38876,the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in
38877,38877,their presence
38878,38878,book thirteen 
38879,38879,chapter i
38880,38880,mans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their
38881,38881,mans soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of
38882,38882,the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the
38883,38883,"him intelligible and says ""this is the cause"" in historical events"
38884,38884,where the actions of men are the subject of observation the first
38885,38885,and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the
38886,38886,prominent positionthe heroes of history but we need only
38887,38887,penetrate to the essence of any historic eventwhich lies in the
38888,38888,activity of the general mass of men who take part in itto be
38889,38889,convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
38890,38890,actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may
38891,38891,seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the
38892,38892,meaning of historical events this way or that yet there is the same
38893,38893,difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on
38894,38894,the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this
38895,38895,declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved
38896,38896,round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the
38897,38897,except the one cause of all causes but there are laws directing
38898,38898,conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these
38899,38899,laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the
38900,38900,discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only
38901,38901,when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth
38902,38902,most important episode of the war of  was the movement of the
38903,38903,russian army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino
38904,38904,campthe socalled flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they
38905,38905,ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and
38906,38906,when they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand
38907,38907,march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia
38908,38908,and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand
38909,38909,mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army
38910,38910,when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions
38911,38911,and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best
38912,38912,position for an army after its retreat from moscow in  was on
38913,38913,the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning
38914,38914,the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a
38915,38915,profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why
38916,38916,they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and
38917,38917,ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french if the position
38918,38918,of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that
38919,38919,that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
38920,38920,destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if
38921,38921,murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained
38922,38922,inactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as
38923,38923,bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french
38924,38924,attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what
38925,38925,attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when
38926,38926,he attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the
38927,38927,french moved on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank
38928,38928,march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous
38929,38929,the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
38930,38930,history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
38931,38931,circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been
38932,38932,accomplished and belonged to the past
38933,38933,at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
38934,38934,a direct retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the
38935,38935,commissariat department lanskoy informed the commander in chief
38936,38936,that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka
38937,38937,the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river
38938,38938,indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously
38939,38939,seemed the most natural coursea direct retreat on nizhninovgorod
38940,38940,its supplies subsequently the inactivity of the french who even
38941,38941,supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula road
38942,38942,no thought of the tarutino position but innumerable circumstances and
38943,38943,the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with
38944,38944,still more to the south and to cross from the tula to the kaluga
38945,38945,supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to
38946,38946,it was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had got
38947,38947,begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and
38948,38948,long ago foreseen its result
38949,38949,chapter ii
38950,38950,the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the
38951,38951,drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant
38952,38952,if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading
38953,38953,describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be
38954,38954,found and where the country was richest
38955,38955,roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that
38956,38956,his army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a
38957,38957,reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the
38958,38958,position he had already occupied near kaluga
38959,38959,having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by
38960,38960,when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push
38961,38961,was receivedassumed the position natural to it
38962,38962,significance of what had happened he alone then understood the
38963,38963,as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to
38964,38964,attackemployed his whole strength to restrain the russian army
38965,38965,from useless engagements
38966,38966,the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
38967,38967,heard to moan
38968,38968,the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed
38969,38969,its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzovs
38970,38970,camp with overtures for peace
38971,38971,though they were meaningless
38972,38972,monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my
38973,38973,adjutantsgeneral to discuss several interesting questions with you i
38974,38974,expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long
38975,38975,gracious protection

38977,38977,"kutuzov replied ""i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on"
38978,38978,as the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present
38979,38979,"spirit of my nation"" but he continued to exert all his powers to"
38980,38980,restrain his troops from attacking

38982,38982,taken place in the relative strength of the two armiesboth in spirit
38983,38983,and in numberas a result of which the superiority had passed to
38984,38984,the russian side though the condition and numbers of the french
38985,38985,need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs these
38986,38986,signs were lauristons mission the abundance of provisions at

38988,38988,disorder of the french the flow of recruits to our regiments the
38989,38989,shows itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what

38996,38996,the emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of
38997,38997,campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance
38998,38998,though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow
38999,38999,basis for action kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from
39000,39000,a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions
39001,39001,were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be
39002,39002,actions and report upon them

39008,39008,flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses only in
39009,39009,interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen
39010,39010,prince michael ilarionovich wrote the emperor on the second of
39011,39011,october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino
39012,39012,since september  moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last

39021,39021,corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem
39022,39022,from tula and other towns in the interior you will be responsible
39023,39023,if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against
39024,39024,petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been

39026,39026,offended country for the loss of moscow you have experienced my
39027,39027,the troops you command justify us in expecting

39033,39033,reported the incident to a general on the staff  the state of
39034,39034,things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had
39035,39035,been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to
39036,39036,use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take
39037,39037,the offensive
39038,39038,"if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you
are asking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure
to do the opposite replied bennigsen"

39060,39060,"theyve put two regiments as outposts and theyre having such a
spree there its awful two bands and three sets of singers"
39061,39061,the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a
39062,39062,distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldiers dance
39063,39063,song proceeding from the house
39064,39064,was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner
39065,39065,the important order entrusted to him it was already past eight

39135,39135,make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners
39136,39136,none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and
39137,39137,shouting and even a little themselvesand it was on this that the
39138,39138,cossacks all busied themselves

39153,39153,"we couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else"
39154,39154,when kutuzov was informed that at the french rearwhere according
39155,39155,to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobodythere
39156,39156,who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous
39157,39157,day
39158,39158,"you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds
but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy
forewarned takes measures accordingly"
39159,39159,ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these
39160,39160,kutuzov would content himself with that hint

39165,39165,the whole battle consisted in what orlovdenisovs cossacks had
39166,39166,done the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly

39175,39175,represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces
39176,39176,descriptions are false
39177,39177,the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had
39178,39178,in viewto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
39179,39179,dispositions nor that which count orlovdenisov may have had in view

39183,39183,what all the russians of that day desiredto drive the french out
39184,39184,of russia and destroy their armyit is quite clear that the battle of
39185,39185,wanted at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even
39186,39186,impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual
39187,39187,outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant

the captain when he makes his round he will do anything for you"
39368,39368,the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with
39369,39369,pierre and showed him all sorts of favors
39370,39370,"you see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril
is a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who
has had misfortunes but he is a man he knows whats what if he
wants anything and asks me he wont get a refusal when one has
studied you see one likes education and wellbred people it is for
your sake i mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not
been for you that affair would have ended ill"
39371,39371,affair he had alluded to had happened a few days beforea fight
39372,39372,succeeded in pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had
39373,39373,heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the
39374,39374,frenchman had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told
39375,39375,came up to the door of the shed rapidly and timidly raising his
39376,39376,the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that
39377,39377,shed
39378,39378,a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to
39379,39379,boots and shirts for them
39380,39380,folded shirt
39381,39381,sewn
39382,39382,none of the prisoners said a word
39383,39383,straight
39384,39384,"you see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no proper
tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse"
39385,39385,work
39386,39386,thanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the
39387,39387,frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note
39388,39388,"and gave it to karataev ""but give me the pieces that are over"""
39389,39389,pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman
39390,39390,frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the
39391,39391,frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over
39392,39392,and asked pierre to translate what he said
39393,39393,"what does he want the bits for said karataev ""theyd make fine"
39394,39394,took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
39395,39395,"frenchman without looking at him ""oh dear"" muttered karataev and"
39396,39396,platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the
39397,39397,odd bits he turned and went out
39398,39398,karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
39399,39399,pieces
39400,39400,back into the shed
39401,39401,chapter xii
39402,39402,four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and
39403,39403,though the french had offered to move him from the mens to the
39404,39404,in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the
39405,39405,extreme limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his
39406,39406,endured his position not only lightly but joyfully and just at this
39407,39407,time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly
39408,39408,striven in vain to reach he had long sought in different ways that
39409,39409,the soldiers at the battle of borodino he had sought it in
39410,39410,natasha he had sought it by reasoningand all these quests and
39411,39411,experiments had failed him and now without thinking about it he had
39412,39412,those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as
39413,39413,it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the
39414,39414,agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important
39415,39415,"concerning them and therefore could not do so ""russia and summer"
39416,39416,in a louder voice
39417,39417,to the door of the shed
39418,39418,a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal
39419,39419,and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had
39420,39420,prisoners had to be counted before being let out
39421,39421,corporal what will they do with the sick man pierre began
39422,39422,but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
39423,39423,drums was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at
39424,39424,sides drowned the sick mans groans
39425,39425,involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the corporals changed
39426,39426,compelled people against their will to kill their fellow menthat
39427,39427,force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to
39428,39428,knew this now one had to wait and endure he did not again go to
39429,39429,door of the hut
39430,39430,his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal
39431,39431,had assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also
39432,39432,pierre had recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the
39433,39433,drums
39434,39434,looking at the prisoners who thronged past him
39435,39435,what now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
39436,39436,pierre
39437,39437,pierre told him about the sick man
39438,39438,"hell manage to walk devil take him said the captain ""pass"
39439,39439,but he is dying pierre again began
39440,39440,understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these
39441,39441,men and that it was now useless to say any more
39442,39442,the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to
39443,39443,strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at
39444,39444,gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other panting
39445,39445,thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when
39446,39446,they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something
39447,39447,being taken and how far they would get that day an official in felt
39448,39448,boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side
39449,39449,as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city
39450,39450,mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow
39451,39451,"what are you disputing about said the major angrily ""what does"
39452,39452,it matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see its
39453,39453,who was not pushing him at all
39454,39454,oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and
39455,39455,"another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins ""all"
39456,39456,well you know its burned so whats the use of talking said the
39457,39457,major
39458,39458,as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few
39459,39459,unburned quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly
39460,39460,started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard
39461,39461,"ah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is and
smeared with something"
39462,39462,pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked
39463,39463,palings surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw
39464,39464,upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot
39465,39465,go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the
39466,39466,were gazing at the dead man
39467,39467,chapter xiv
39468,39468,through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners
39469,39469,came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
39470,39470,private vehicles
39471,39471,across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving
39472,39472,stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais
39473,39473,transport
39474,39474,the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga
39475,39475,road but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of
39476,39476,beauharnais train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the
39477,39477,kaluga road when the vanguard of neys army was already emerging
39478,39478,from the great ordynka street
39479,39479,when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few
39480,39480,and men crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few
39481,39481,the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at
39482,39482,listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll
39483,39483,of the drums
39484,39484,wall of the halfburned house against which pierre was leaning
39485,39485,"what crowds just look at the crowds theyve loaded goods
even on the cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed ""just"
39486,39486,see what the blackguards have looted there see what that one
39487,39487,those chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks
39488,39488,"heavens theyre fighting"""
39489,39489,"thats right hit him on the snouton his snout like this we
shant get away before evening look look there why that must be
napoleons own see what horses and the monograms with a crown
its like a portable house that fellows dropped his sack and
doesnt see it fighting again a woman with a baby and not
badlooking either yes i dare say thats the way theyll let you
pass just look theres no end to it russian wenches by heaven
so they are in carriagessee how comfortably theyve settled
themselves"
39490,39490,from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the
39491,39491,mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful
39492,39492,neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women
39493,39493,hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow all that he now
39494,39494,weaken it
39495,39495,pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement
39496,39496,all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some
39497,39497,invisible power during the hour pierre watched them they all came
39498,39498,flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get
39499,39499,swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck
39500,39500,pierre that morning on the corporals face when the drums were
39501,39501,beating
39502,39502,it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the
39503,39503,escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way
39504,39504,sun began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men
39505,39505,began to prepare for their nights rest they all appeared angry and
39506,39506,be heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran
39507,39507,into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole
39508,39508,several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat
39509,39509,wounded on the head by a sword
39510,39510,the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and
39511,39511,eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a
39512,39512,standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know
39513,39513,awaited them on this journey
39514,39514,during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than
39515,39515,they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the
39516,39516,first time received horseflesh for their meat ration
39517,39517,from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what
39518,39518,unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations
39519,39519,escaped pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for
39520,39520,reprimand and threaten to courtmartial a noncommissioned officer on
39521,39521,account of the escape of the russian to the noncommissioned officers
39522,39522,replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind pierre
39523,39523,felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the
39524,39524,and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it
39525,39525,he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with
39526,39526,his comrades
39527,39527,neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen
39528,39528,the order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in
39529,39529,reaction against the worsening of their position they were all
39530,39530,avoided all talk of their present situation
39531,39531,the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in
39532,39532,the sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon
39533,39533,crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where
39534,39534,he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he
39535,39535,wanted to talk to them on the road he was stopped by a french
39536,39536,sentinel who ordered him back
39537,39537,unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him
39538,39538,and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of
39539,39539,the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought
39540,39540,to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean
39541,39541,"hahaha laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself ""the"
39542,39542,soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me
39543,39543,he laughed till tears started to his eyes
39544,39544,a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing
39545,39545,red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the
39546,39546,distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the
39547,39547,went and lay down to sleep beside his companions
39548,39548,chapter xv
39549,39549,in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a
39550,39550,though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga
39551,39551,road kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one
39552,39552,question of peace
39553,39553,soon after that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilla
39554,39554,detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of
39555,39555,broussiers division had been seen at forminsk and that being
39556,39556,separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be
39557,39557,destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals
39558,39558,urged kutuzov to carry out dorokhovs suggestion kutuzov did not
39559,39559,consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which
39560,39560,was inevitable a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack
39561,39561,broussier
39562,39562,modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing
39563,39563,spoken of as undecided and undiscerningbut whom we find commanding
39564,39564,wherever the position was most difficult all through the
39565,39565,russofrench wars from austerlitz to the year  at austerlitz he
39566,39566,was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single
39567,39567,general was left in the rear guard ill with fever he went to smolensk
39568,39568,with twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleons whole
39569,39569,a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the
39570,39570,when bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank
39571,39571,had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was
39572,39572,undiscerning dokhturovkutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he
39573,39573,had made by sending someone else there first and the quiet little
39574,39574,the russian army many heroes have been described to us in verse and
39575,39575,it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there
39576,39576,was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army
39577,39577,began and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of
39578,39578,dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest
39579,39579,testimony to his merit
39580,39580,it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
39581,39581,machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
39582,39582,and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
39583,39583,important part the man who does not understand the construction of
39584,39584,the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
39585,39585,and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working
39586,39586,on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to
39587,39587,apparently in order to give battlesuddenly without any reason turned
39588,39588,off to the left onto the new kaluga road and began to enter
39589,39589,two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin
39590,39590,on the evening of october  seslavin came to the aristovo
39591,39591,headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner
39592,39592,said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the
39593,39593,had left moscow four days previously that same evening a house serf
39594,39594,who had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering
39595,39595,the town some cossacks of dokhturovs detachment reported having
39596,39596,sighted the french guards marching along the road to borovsk from all
39597,39597,these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a
39598,39598,single division there was now the whole french army marching from
39599,39599,moscow in an unexpected directionalong the kaluga road dokhturov
39600,39600,now what he ought to do he had been ordered to attack forminsk but
39601,39601,only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french
39602,39602,dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzovs instructions so it was
39603,39603,decided to send a dispatch to the staff
39604,39604,accompanied by a cossack with spare horses
39605,39605,chapter xvi
39606,39606,days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour
39607,39607,after one oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle
39608,39608,entered a dark passage
39609,39609,the general on duty quick its very important said he to
39610,39610,someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage
39611,39611,"he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third
night he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper"
39612,39612,you should wake the captain first
39613,39613,but this is very important from general dokhturov said
39614,39614,the dark
39615,39615,the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody
39616,39616,your honor your honor a courier
39617,39617,what whats that from whom came a sleepy voice
39618,39618,from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk
39619,39619,guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn
39620,39620,the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself
39621,39621,"very ill perhaps this is only a rumor"""
39622,39622,"here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov ""my orders are to give"
39623,39623,"it at once to the general on duty"""
39624,39624,ive found it ive found it he added
39625,39625,the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for
39626,39626,something on the candlestick
39627,39627,oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust
39628,39628,by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinins
39629,39629,was still asleep this was konovnitsyn
39630,39630,when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
39631,39631,the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
39632,39632,bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it
39633,39633,with his sleeve
39634,39634,"and the scouts all say the same thing"""
39635,39635,theres nothing to be done well have to wake him said
39636,39636,"covered by a greatcoat ""peter petrovich"" said he konovnitsyn did"
39637,39637,that those words would be sure to arouse him
39638,39638,and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on
39639,39639,there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
39640,39640,assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance
39641,39641,well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without
39642,39642,while listening to the officers report konovnitsyn broke the seal
39643,39643,and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his
39644,39644,legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began
39645,39645,did you get here quickly let us go to his highness
39646,39646,konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of
39647,39647,great importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or
39648,39648,ask himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest
39649,39649,him he regarded the whole business of the war not with his
39650,39650,intelligence or his reason but by something else there was within him
39651,39651,strength to the task
39652,39652,included merely for proprietys sake in the list of the socalled
39653,39653,miloradoviches like dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of
39654,39654,made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most
39655,39655,difficult since his appointment as general on duty he had always
39656,39656,partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant
39657,39657,and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him
39658,39658,though he knew it could not be helped
39659,39659,immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his
39660,39660,him that they must go to see his highness
39661,39661,chapter xvii
39662,39662,kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often
39663,39663,peering into the darkness
39664,39664,kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his
39665,39665,troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the
39666,39666,others too
39667,39667,"they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive
patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov"
39668,39668,he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will
39669,39669,but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided
39670,39670,question now by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been
39671,39671,that the wound was mortal but he needed further proofs and it was
39672,39672,necessary to wait
39673,39673,"they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall
see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he ""what"
39674,39674,for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are
39675,39675,like children from whom one cant get any sensible account of what has
39676,39676,happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but
39677,39677,thats not what is needed now
39678,39678,"and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to
them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he"
39679,39679,"remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg ""they have"
39680,39680,"foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless"""
39681,39681,the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino
39682,39682,was mortal or not had hung over kutuzovs head for a whole month on
39683,39683,the one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt
39684,39684,assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and
39685,39685,all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal
39686,39686,but in any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for
39687,39687,them and grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed
39688,39688,during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those
39689,39689,younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts of possible
39690,39690,that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and
39691,39691,based nothing on them the longer he thought the more contingencies
39692,39692,presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the
39693,39693,which he feared most of all that napoleon might fight him with his
39694,39694,own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutuzov even imagined
39695,39695,convulsive stampede of napoleons army during its first eleven days
39696,39696,after leaving moscow a stampede which made possible what kutuzov
39697,39697,had not yet even dared to think ofthe complete extermination of
39698,39698,the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were
39699,39699,to kutuzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to
39700,39700,how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary
39701,39701,and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe
39702,39702,it this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to
39703,39703,him only lifes customary routine to such customary routine
39704,39704,desire
39705,39705,on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm
39706,39706,and thinking of that
39707,39707,eh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal
39708,39708,called out to them
39709,39709,substance of the news
39710,39710,there can be no doubt about it your highness
39711,39711,call him in call him here
39712,39712,kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big
39713,39713,paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he
39714,39714,screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more
39715,39715,own mind
39716,39716,"napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh"""
39717,39717,bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he
39718,39718,had been told to report
39719,39719,speak quicker quicker dont torture me kutuzov interrupted him
39720,39720,instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov
39721,39721,and wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side
39722,39722,o lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in a
39723,39723,"lord"" and he wept"

39731,39731,have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich
39732,39732,southern provinces
39733,39733,but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from
39734,39734,advancing into those southern provinces for the russian army did
39735,39735,inevitable ruin how could that armywhich had found abundant
39736,39736,supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of
39737,39737,instead of storing themhow could that army recuperate in kaluga

39742,39742,hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious
39743,39743,mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simpleminded soldier

39745,39745,there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must

39747,39747,"lempereur"""
39748,39748,the day after the council at maloyaroslavets napoleon rode out
39749,39749,early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of
39750,39750,the scene of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks
39751,39751,on the prowl for booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly
39752,39752,the booty on which the cossacks fell here as at tarutino they went
39753,39753,after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape
39754,39754,when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor
39755,39755,familiar road napoleon with his fortyyearold stomach understood
39756,39756,the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once
39757,39757,agreed with mouton and issued ordersas the historians tell usto
39758,39758,retreat by the smolensk road
39759,39759,which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk
39760,39760,chapter xix
39761,39761,a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to
39762,39762,go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him
39763,39763,at the end of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a
39764,39764,promised land to have the strength to move
39765,39765,the promised land for the french during their advance had been
39766,39766,absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to
39767,39767,"himself ""today i shall get to a place twentyfive miles off where i"
39768,39768,"melted away on the road from moscow to vyazma without any battle"" but"
39769,39769,near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up
39770,39770,they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope
39771,39771,thousands of men
39772,39772,book fourteen 
39773,39773,chapter i
39774,39774,one of the most instructive phenomena in history
39775,39775,all historians agree that the external activity of states and
39776,39776,and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the
39777,39777,political strength of states and nations increases or decreases
39778,39778,strange as may be the historical account of how some king or
39779,39779,the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one
39780,39780,nationeven though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army
39781,39781,a hundredth part of a nationshould oblige that whole nation to
39782,39782,conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated
39783,39783,suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated
39784,39784,so according to history it has been found from the most ancient
39785,39785,confirm this rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army
39786,39786,increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy
39787,39787,the independent existence of prussia
39788,39788,then napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of
39789,39789,history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the
39790,39790,after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement
39791,39791,what does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of
39792,39792,the historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their
39793,39793,standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which
39794,39794,it happened in the greatest of all known wars
39795,39795,the period of the campaign of  from the battle of borodino to
39796,39796,the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does
39797,39797,not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of
39798,39798,conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples
39799,39799,something else
39800,39800,forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one
39801,39801,than let the french have it
39802,39802,the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the
39803,39803,peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow
39804,39804,let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with
39805,39805,rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing the
39806,39806,feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke
39807,39807,cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine
39808,39808,that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest
39809,39809,means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by
39810,39810,insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to
39811,39811,all the rules of art one can imagine what confusion and obscurity
39812,39812,would result from such an account of the duel
39813,39813,the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of
39814,39814,fencing was the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier
39815,39815,and snatched up the cudgel was the russian people those who try to
39816,39816,explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the
39817,39817,historians who have described the event
39818,39818,after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any
39819,39819,from the rules
39820,39820,attitude in moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgel
39821,39821,to the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to
39822,39822,all the rulesas if there were any rules for killing people in spite
39823,39823,of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the
39824,39824,seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to
39825,39825,and without consulting anyones tastes or rules and regardless of
39826,39826,perished
39827,39827,and it is well for a people who do notas the french did in 
39828,39828,up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the
39829,39829,feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of
39830,39830,contempt and compassion
39831,39831,chapter ii
39832,39832,one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the
39833,39833,socalled laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men
39834,39834,pressed together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that
39835,39835,"people have called this kind of war ""guerrilla warfare"" and assume"
39836,39836,that by so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a
39837,39837,war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a
39838,39838,wellknown rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible that
39839,39839,rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to
39840,39840,be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict
39841,39841,infringes that rule
39842,39842,this contradiction arises from the fact that military science
39843,39843,assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers
39844,39844,military science says that the more troops the greater the strength
39845,39845,les gros bataillons ont toujours raison
39846,39846,large battalions are always victorious
39847,39847,for military science to say this is like defining momentum in
39848,39848,mechanics by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are
39849,39849,equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved
39850,39850,are equal or unequal
39851,39851,momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity
39852,39852,in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its
39853,39853,mass and some unknown x
39854,39854,fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and
39855,39855,existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover itnow in a
39856,39856,these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which
39857,39857,accord with the historic facts
39858,39858,yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to
39859,39859,"gratify the ""heroes"" of the efficacy of the directions issued in"
39860,39860,greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the
39861,39861,minute men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most
39862,39862,advantageous conditions for fighting
39863,39863,the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass
39864,39864,gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of
39865,39865,this unknown factorthe spirit of an armyis a problem for science
39866,39866,this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to
39867,39867,substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that
39868,39868,quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to
39869,39869,can we hope to define the unknown
39870,39870,on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to
39871,39871,equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us
39872,39872,a ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected
39873,39873,should exist and might be discovered
39874,39874,the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when
39875,39875,the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to
39876,39876,lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only by
39877,39877,movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks but
39878,39878,this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army
39879,39879,continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking
39880,39880,contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of
39881,39881,should have separated into detachments to defend themselves
39882,39882,congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen
39883,39883,french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose
39884,39884,themselves to hardships and dangers
39885,39885,chapter iii
39886,39886,the socalled partisan war began with the entry of the french into
39887,39887,smolensk
39888,39888,before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
39889,39889,as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis
39890,39890,value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of
39891,39891,for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare
39892,39892,on august  davydovs first partisan detachment was formed and then
39893,39893,others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more
39894,39894,numerous these detachments became
39895,39895,the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the
39896,39896,fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree
39897,39897,and the comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack
39898,39898,groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown a sacristan
39899,39899,commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the
39900,39900,the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
39901,39901,hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the
39902,39902,end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had
39903,39903,become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what
39904,39904,regarded many things as impossible the small bands that had started
39905,39905,their activities long before and had already observed the french
39906,39906,closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big
39907,39907,detachments did not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who
39908,39908,crept in among the french now considered everything possible
39909,39909,his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early
39910,39910,morning he and his party had been on the move all day long he had
39911,39911,been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french
39912,39912,convoy of cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the
39913,39913,was moving under a strong escort to smolensk besides denisov and
39914,39914,the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this
39915,39915,it two of the commanders of large partiesone a pole and the other a
39916,39916,requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy
39917,39917,no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on
39918,39918,he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command
39919,39919,of the polish general to the polish general he replied to the same
39920,39920,german
39921,39921,convoy with their own small forces on october  it was moving from
39922,39922,the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the
39923,39923,extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile
39924,39924,or more back from it through these forests denisov and his party rode
39925,39925,in the mud not far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the
39926,39926,the french without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach
39927,39927,dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a
39928,39928,fresh columns of french should show themselves
39929,39929,reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two
39930,39930,numbers did not deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what
39931,39931,"troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a ""tongue""that"
39932,39932,had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all
39933,39933,was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops
39934,39934,in that column
39935,39935,denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear

39937,39937,advance
39938,39938,chapter iv
39939,39939,it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both
39940,39940,then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down
39941,39941,denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain
39942,39942,ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides
39943,39943,shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him his

39945,39945,selfsatisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to
39946,39946,glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and

39953,39953,morning
39954,39954,fallen leaves that strewed the road the men sat huddled up trying not

40252,40252,"""who goes there"""
40253,40253,the blood rushed to petyas face and he grasped his pistol

40259,40259,dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk

40262,40262,"quand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas
le mot dordre cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding"

40264,40264,"the password i am asking you if the colonel is here"""
40265,40265,stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were the
40266,40266,and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were
40267,40267,called the landowners house
40268,40268,talking noisily something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge
40269,40269,oh hes a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was
40270,40270,sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire
40271,40271,laughing
40272,40272,dolokhovs and petyas steps as they advanced to the fire leading
40273,40273,their horses
40274,40274,bonjour messieurs said dolokhov loudly and clearly
40275,40275,to dolokhov
40276,40276,dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake
40277,40277,and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and
40278,40278,dolokhov with hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were
40279,40279,silent
40280,40280,"if you were counting on the evening soup you have come too
late said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh"
40281,40281,dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on
40282,40282,farther that night
40283,40283,he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot
40284,40284,and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the
40285,40285,long neck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and
40286,40286,which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far
40287,40287,the road before them was safe from cossacks
40288,40288,those brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind
40289,40289,the fire
40290,40290,dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
40291,40291,"to attack large detachments"" he added inquiringly no one replied"
40292,40292,well now hell come away petya thought every moment as he
40293,40293,stood by the campfire listening to the talk
40294,40294,but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and
40295,40295,began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the
40296,40296,strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their
40297,40297,whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and
40298,40298,whispered something to a companion dolokhov got up and called to
40299,40299,the soldier who was holding their horses
40300,40300,drawing nearer to dolokhov
40301,40301,the horses were brought
40302,40302,good evening gentlemen said dolokhov
40303,40303,"petya wished to say ""good night"" but could not utter a word the"
40304,40304,officers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting
40305,40305,coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the
40306,40306,"listened ""do you hear"" he asked petya recognized the sound of"
40307,40307,russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round

40312,40312,all right all right said dolokhov but petya did not let go of
40313,40313,him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward

40315,40315,"still get a nap before morning"""
40316,40316,"sleeping before a battle"""
40317,40317,he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his

40319,40319,day
40320,40320,doors
40321,40321,still falling from the trees near the watchmans hut the black shapes
40322,40322,of the cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be
40323,40323,seen behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their
40324,40324,campfire gleamed red not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep

40336,40336,the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look
40337,40337,at petya

40339,40339,"then theyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like that"""
40340,40340,just so said the cossack

40344,40344,on its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon
40345,40345,i say are the lads asleep asked petya
40346,40346,some are and some arentlike us
40347,40347,well and that boy

40351,40351,what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon
40352,40352,why this gentlemans saber
40353,40353,was the cup left here
40354,40354,there by the wheel
40355,40355,the hussar took the cup
40356,40356,petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisovs
40357,40357,come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew
40358,40358,nor waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom
40359,40359,where nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be
40360,40360,the watchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very
40361,40361,the eye of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a
40362,40362,it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back
40363,40363,altogether and dissolved into nothingness
40364,40364,nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him he was
40365,40365,in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible
40366,40366,he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the
40367,40367,swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if
40368,40368,it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed
40369,40369,that one could touch it with ones hand
40370,40370,petyas eyes began to close and he swayed a little
40371,40371,the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed
40372,40372,and jostled one another someone snored
40373,40373,ozhegzheg ozhegzheg hissed the saber against the
40374,40374,particularly fresh and attractive the music became more and more
40375,40375,audible the melody grew and passed from one instrument to another
40376,40376,and what was played was a fuguethough petya had not the least
40377,40377,conception of what a fugue is each instrumentnow resembling a
40378,40378,third and a fourth and they all blended into one and again became
40379,40379,something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant
40380,40380,"delightful as much as i like and as i like"" said petya to himself"
40381,40381,he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra
40382,40382,"now softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him ""now"
40383,40383,"unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds ""now voices join"
40384,40384,"in"" ordered petya and at first from afar he heard mens voices and"
40385,40385,petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy
40386,40386,choir but joining in it
40387,40387,petya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all
40388,40388,one to share it he was awakened by likhachevs kindly voice
40389,40389,its ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it
40390,40390,petya woke up
40391,40391,its getting light its really getting light he exclaimed
40392,40392,the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to
40393,40393,sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening
40394,40394,their saddle girths
40395,40395,and heres the commander said likhachev

40401,40401,particularly brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his
40402,40402,whole body pulsed rhythmically
40403,40403,"well is evwything weady asked denisov ""bwing the horses"""
40404,40404,the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack

40406,40406,"vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for
gods sake said he"
40407,40407,denisov seemed to have forgotten petyas very existence he turned
40408,40408,to glance at him
40409,40409,"yourself forward anywhere"""
40410,40410,he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the
40411,40411,way when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably
40412,40412,growing light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the
40413,40413,esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had
40414,40414,denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him
40415,40415,the signal said he
40416,40416,the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the
40417,40417,shouted at him it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was
40418,40418,fired it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge
40419,40419,cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the
40420,40420,running from right to left across the road one of them fell in the
40421,40421,mud under his horses feet
40422,40422,clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him
40423,40423,excited horse he galloped forward along the village street

40425,40425,"galloped up the frenchman had already fallen ""too late again"""
40426,40426,flashed through petyas mind and he galloped on to the place from
40427,40427,which the rapid firing could be heard the shots came from the yard of
40428,40428,the landowners house he had visited the night before with dolokhov
40429,40429,the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden
40430,40430,thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who
40431,40431,"shouting to his men ""go round wait for the infantry"" he exclaimed"
40432,40432,as petya rode up to him
40433,40433,galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
40434,40434,smoke was thickest
40435,40435,plashed against something the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after
40436,40436,petya into the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke
40437,40437,some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes
40438,40438,holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and
40439,40439,wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly

40443,40443,denisov who was riding toward him
40444,40444,unmistakably lifeless attitudevery familiar to himin which petyas
40445,40445,body was lying
40446,40446,done for repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words
40447,40447,"were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up ""we wont take"
40448,40448,"them"" he called out to denisov"
40449,40449,mudbespattered face which had already gone white
40450,40450,i am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all
40451,40451,he recalled petyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise
40452,40452,among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was
40453,40453,pierre bezukhov
40454,40454,chapter xii
40455,40455,during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been
40456,40456,issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners
40457,40457,among whom was pierre on the twentysecond of october that party
40458,40458,was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it
40459,40459,had left moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled
40460,40460,half had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had
40461,40461,marched in front of the prisoners was left they had all
40462,40462,disappeared the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them
40463,40463,during the first days was now replaced by marshal junots enormous
40464,40464,cavalry baggage train
40465,40465,that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving
40466,40466,moscow had now reached the utmost limit
40467,40467,the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
40468,40468,horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
40469,40469,lagging behind it
40470,40470,several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
40471,40471,abused each other for their causeless panic
40472,40472,melting away
40473,40473,of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred
40474,40474,captured or left behind some of junots wagons also had been captured
40475,40475,or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers
40476,40476,from davouts corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned
40477,40477,that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to
40478,40478,been shot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon
40479,40479,belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession
40480,40480,the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three
40481,40481,hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a
40482,40482,hundred now remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort
40483,40483,than even the cavalry saddles or junots baggage they understood that
40484,40484,and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and
40485,40485,hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which case
40486,40486,the order was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but
40487,40487,them with particular moroseness and severity
40488,40488,but were recaptured by the french and shot
40489,40489,pierre had rejoined karataev and the grayblue bandylegged dog that
40490,40490,had chosen karataev for its master
40491,40491,on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with
40492,40492,grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know
40493,40493,effort to go near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning
40494,40494,he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than
40495,40495,while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his
40496,40496,not from privation but from superfluity and now during these last
40497,40497,truththat nothing in this world is terrible he had learned that
40498,40498,as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely
40499,40499,freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and
40500,40500,that those limits are very near together that the person in a bed
40501,40501,sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while
40502,40502,the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes
40503,40503,he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
40504,40504,that were covered with soreshis footgear having long since fallen to
40505,40505,pieces he discovered that when he had married his wifeof his own
40506,40506,free will as it had seemed to himhe had been no more free than now
40507,40507,when they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself
40508,40508,the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was
40509,40509,devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to
40510,40510,bear was his feet
40511,40511,but thought of other things
40512,40512,only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
40513,40513,saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to
40514,40514,superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain
40515,40515,limit
40516,40516,he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who
40517,40517,not think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would
40518,40518,soon have to share that fate still less did pierre think about
40519,40519,himself the harder his position became and the more terrible the
40520,40520,imaginings that came to him
40521,40521,chapter xiii
40522,40522,at midday on the twentysecond of october pierre was going uphill
40523,40523,roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd
40524,40524,around him and then again at his feet the former and the latter
40525,40525,were alike familiar and his own the bluegray bandy legged dog ran
40526,40526,agility and selfsatisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along
40527,40527,the crows that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker

40529,40529,animalsfrom men to horsesin various stages of decomposition and
40530,40530,as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all
40531,40531,it wanted
40532,40532,it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment
40533,40533,raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed
40534,40534,"harder"""
40535,40535,deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and
40536,40536,comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction
40537,40537,from a conversation with karataev the day before
40538,40538,burning better there platon karataev was sitting covered uphead and
40539,40539,in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre
40540,40540,free of his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the
40541,40541,his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he
40542,40542,trying not to look at platon
40543,40543,well how are you he asked
40544,40544,how am i if we grumble at sickness god wont grant us death
40545,40545,pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told
40546,40546,it to him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially
40547,40547,felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was
40548,40548,of an old merchant who lived a good and godfearing life with his
40549,40549,rich merchant
40550,40550,his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained

40578,40578,thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy
40579,40579,the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with
40580,40580,officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their
40581,40581,faces all looked excited and worried
40582,40582,what did he say what did he say pierre heard them ask
40583,40583,morning he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on
40584,40584,there was now an expression of quiet solemnity

40586,40586,something to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself
40587,40587,he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away
40588,40588,when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round
40589,40589,karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch
40590,40590,tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look
40591,40591,round again but went limping up the hill

40619,40619,summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the
40620,40620,veranda of his house in kiev and without linking up the events of the
40621,40621,seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories
40622,40622,water so that it closed over his head
40623,40623,before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid
40624,40624,firing french soldiers were running past him
40625,40625,russians surrounded pierre
40626,40626,for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him
40627,40627,all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy
40628,40628,as they embraced cossacks and hussars
40629,40629,the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered
40630,40630,sat among them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier
40631,40631,dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched

40639,40639,and dukes but the process of the flight and disintegration of the
40640,40640,french army went on essentially as before
40641,40641,from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventythree thousand
40642,40642,men not reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but
40643,40643,thousand had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding
40644,40644,terms of the progression could be determined mathematically the
40645,40645,french army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to
40646,40646,from the berezina to vilnaindependently of the greater or lesser
40647,40647,other particular conditions beyond vyazma the french army instead
40648,40648,on to the end berthier wrote to his emperor we know how far
40649,40649,commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in
40650,40650,describing the condition of an army and this is what he said
40651,40651,i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the
40652,40652,various corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages
40653,40653,of the last two or three days march they are almost disbanded
40654,40654,scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of
40655,40655,directions hoping to find food and escape discipline in general
40656,40656,they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover during
40657,40657,the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their
40658,40658,demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk and should first
40659,40659,rest many have died last days on the road or at the bivouacs this
40660,40660,state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear
40661,40661,that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be
40662,40662,under control in case of an engagement
40663,40663,november  twenty miles from smolensk

40668,40668,chapter xvii
40669,40669,the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign
40670,40670,from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian
40671,40671,occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
40672,40672,escape runs straight into his opponents arms
40673,40673,reached the smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell
40674,40674,tightand often thinking they were escaping ran right into the
40675,40675,russians
40676,40676,owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit
40677,40677,approximately ascertaining the enemys positionby cavalry
40678,40678,obtained could not be delivered in time if news was received one
40679,40679,already two days march farther on and in quite another position
40680,40680,one army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were
40681,40681,thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned
40682,40682,separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of
40683,40683,the road to the right beyond the dnieperwhich was the only
40684,40684,reasonable thing for him to dothemselves turned to the right and
40685,40685,came out onto the highroad at krasnoe and here as in a game of
40686,40686,blindmans buff the french ran into our vanguard seeing their enemy
40687,40687,unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the
40688,40688,comrades who were farther behind then for three days separate
40689,40689,russians by night by making semicircles to the right
40690,40690,crossed the dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot

40692,40692,or die
40693,40693,chapter xviii
40694,40694,this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which
40695,40695,they did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they
40696,40696,turned onto the kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the
40697,40697,have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the
40698,40698,retreat fit their theory but no mountains of books have been written
40699,40699,the retreat from maloyaroslavets when he had a free road into a
40700,40700,wellsupplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
40701,40701,which kutuzov afterwards pursued himthis unnecessary retreat along a
40702,40702,devastated roadis explained to us as being due to profound
40703,40703,considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his
40704,40704,retreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is
40705,40705,and said
40706,40706,jai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le general but

40710,40710,especially of neya greatness of soul consisting in this that he

40712,40712,of his men
40713,40713,army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
40714,40714,ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is
40715,40715,taught to be ashamed ofeven that act finds justification in the
40716,40716,historians language
40717,40717,when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of
40718,40718,warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his
40719,40719,"""it is great"""

40725,40725,and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not
40726,40726,commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to
40727,40727,admit ones own nothingness and immeasurable meanness
40728,40728,human actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where
40729,40729,chapter xix
40730,40730,that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three
40731,40731,when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim
40732,40732,was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us
40733,40733,that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not
40734,40734,beat them how could that happen
40735,40735,history or what is called by that name replying to these questions
40736,40736,but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were
40737,40737,guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried
40738,40738,was at krasnoe and at the berezina in both cases we had superior
40739,40739,the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military
40740,40740,historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is
40741,40741,attacking at vyazma and tarutino
40742,40742,why was the russian armywhich with inferior forces had withstood
40743,40743,the enemy in full strength at borodinodefeated at krasnoe and the
40744,40744,berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was
40745,40745,numerically superior
40746,40746,if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
40747,40747,napoleon and his marshalsand that aim was not merely frustrated
40748,40748,but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledthen
40749,40749,this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the
40750,40750,victorious by russian historians
40751,40751,the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
40752,40752,that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for
40753,40753,napoleon and defeats for kutuzov
40754,40754,but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
40755,40755,russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
40756,40756,liberation of their country
40757,40757,the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the
40758,40758,historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns
40759,40759,have attributed to this last period of the war of  an aim that
40760,40760,with his marshals and his army
40761,40761,been senseless and its attainment quite impossible
40762,40762,the use of performing various operations on the french who were
40763,40763,running away as fast as they possibly could
40764,40764,whose whole energy was directed to flight
40765,40765,army
40766,40766,diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others recognized
40767,40767,still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of
40768,40768,reaching krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy
40769,40769,full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger
40770,40770,all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon
40771,40771,out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had
40772,40772,only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he
40773,40773,was very angry but not even that could be said for those who drew
40774,40774,trampled beds
40775,40775,but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would
40776,40776,it was impossible first becauseas experience shows that a
40777,40777,threemile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with
40778,40778,effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to
40779,40779,he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great
40780,40780,distances do not yield the desired results
40781,40781,the russians possessed would have been required
40782,40782,always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when
40783,40783,themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only
40784,40784,is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on ones hand men
40785,40785,can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules
40786,40786,hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike
40787,40787,world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those
40788,40788,french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done
40789,40789,more without destroying itself
40790,40790,during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe
40791,40791,the population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of
40792,40792,the army without a battle
40793,40793,and it is of this period of the campaignwhen the army lacked boots
40794,40794,was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees
40795,40795,the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
40796,40796,period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich
40797,40797,cut off the french and so on and so on
40798,40798,that they should do what was impossible
40799,40799,all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between
40800,40800,the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the
40801,40801,historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the
40802,40802,history of the events
40803,40803,their surmises and the rewards this or that general received but
40804,40804,the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals
40805,40805,the range of their investigation
40806,40806,yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans
40807,40807,and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who
40808,40808,insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution
40809,40809,the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in
40810,40810,the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it
40811,40811,was senseless and unattainable
40812,40812,the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion
40813,40813,secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying
40814,40814,stopped
40815,40815,the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the
40816,40816,experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a

40827,40827,had opened out before them
40828,40828,only when alone together were they free from such outrage and
40829,40829,was of very unimportant matters

40832,40832,they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them
40833,40833,that what they had lived through and experienced could not be

40835,40835,accomplished before their eyes

40848,40848,to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm
40849,40849,cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded
40850,40850,for the journey to moscow
40851,40851,princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to
40852,40852,their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change
40853,40853,of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her
40854,40854,i am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to
40855,40855,with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation
40856,40856,rather than of sorrow
40857,40857,after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her
40858,40858,twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing
40859,40859,intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this
40860,40860,solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of
40861,40861,impatiently for the intruder to go
40862,40862,she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
40863,40863,on whichwith a terrible questioning too great for her strength
40864,40864,her spiritual gaze was fixed
40865,40865,crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at
40866,40866,a corner of the door
40867,40867,she was gazing in the direction in which he had goneto the other
40868,40868,before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and
40869,40869,desolation or suffering and indignity
40870,40870,she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine
40871,40871,him otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he
40872,40872,and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken
40873,40873,his head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his
40874,40874,a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs
40875,40875,"struggling with terrible pain ""what is that pain like why does he"
40876,40876,"have that pain what does he feel how does it hurt him"" thought"
40877,40877,speak seriously
40878,40878,"one thing would be terrible said he ""to bind oneself forever"
40879,40879,"to a suffering man it would be continual torture"" and he looked"
40880,40880,searchingly at her natasha as usual answered before she had time to
40881,40881,"think what she would say she said ""this cant go onit wont you"
40882,40882,"will get wellquite well"""
40883,40883,she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what
40884,40884,she had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at
40885,40885,those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in
40886,40886,that protracted gaze
40887,40887,dreadful if he always continued to suffer i said it then only because
40888,40888,he thought it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live
40889,40889,and feared death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not
40890,40890,say what i meant i thought quite differently had i said what i
40891,40891,"possible to put it right"" and now he again seemed to be saying the"
40892,40892,convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate
40893,40893,effort
40894,40894,she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in
40895,40895,her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this
40896,40896,with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was and
40897,40897,the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing
40898,40898,itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her
40899,40899,frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress
40900,40900,suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natashas whole
40901,40901,as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying but
40902,40902,the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the
40903,40903,oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life
40904,40904,her own grief
40905,40905,out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to
40906,40906,her natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid
40907,40907,the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward
40908,40908,sonya and the maids were holding her arms
40909,40909,"natasha natasha cried the countess ""its not true its"
40910,40910,"ha its not true"""
40911,40911,mummy darling i am here my dearest mummy she kept on
40912,40912,mothers dress
40913,40913,my dearest darling mummy my precious she whispered
40914,40914,own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks
40915,40915,became quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed
40916,40916,press her daughters head with all her strength then she turned
40917,40917,toward her daughters face which was wincing with pain and gazed
40918,40918,long at it
40919,40919,natasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper
40920,40920,natasha you would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truth
40921,40921,natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look
40922,40922,there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness
40923,40923,love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that
40924,40924,crushed her mother
40925,40925,to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in
40926,40926,next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother
40927,40927,her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the
40928,40928,her to life
40929,40929,during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few
40930,40930,creak the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly
40931,40931,"how glad i am you have come you are tired wont you have some
tea natasha went up to her ""you have improved in looks and grown"
40932,40932,natasha he is no more no more

40934,40934,chapter iii
40935,40935,princess mary postponed her departure sonya and the count tried
40936,40936,to replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able
40937,40937,to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks
40938,40938,soothed her mother
40939,40939,the mothers wounded spirit could not heal petyas
40940,40940,death had torn from her half her life when the news of petyas
40941,40941,month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no
40942,40942,a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is
40943,40943,can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from
40944,40944,within
40945,40945,natashas wound healed in that way she thought her life was
40946,40946,essence of lifelovewas still active within her love awoke and
40947,40947,so did life
40948,40948,prince andrews last days had bound princess mary and natasha
40949,40949,together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another
40950,40950,after natasha as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed
40951,40951,in her mothers bedroom had strained natashas physical strength
40952,40952,took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay
40953,40953,she called her back
40954,40954,i dont want to sleep mary sit by me a little
40955,40955,you are tiredtry to sleep
40956,40956,no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me
40957,40957,she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary
40958,40958,natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
40959,40959,princess marys face
40960,40960,what is in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind
40961,40961,"mary you mustnt think me wicked no mary darling how i love
you let us be quite quite friends"
40962,40962,princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her
40963,40963,feelings
40964,40964,from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
40965,40965,between women was established between princess mary and natasha
40966,40966,they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one
40967,40967,another and spent most of their time together when one went out the
40968,40968,other became restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt
40969,40969,more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself
40970,40970,when alone a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them
40971,40971,an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each others
40972,40972,presence
40973,40973,sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were
40974,40974,already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they
40975,40975,spoke most of what was long past princess mary spoke of her
40976,40976,side of life previously incomprehensible to her she did not think
40977,40977,another those previously incomprehensible virtues for princess
40978,40978,also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life belief
40979,40979,in life and its enjoyment
40980,40980,thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him
40981,40981,had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without
40982,40982,being conscious of it
40983,40983,natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
40984,40984,one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath
40985,40985,called againthough she could hear dunyasha comingcalled her in the
40986,40986,listened attentively to herself
40987,40987,root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed
40988,40988,her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound
40989,40989,had begun to heal from within
40990,40990,insisted on natashas going with her to consult the doctors
40991,40991,chapter iv
40992,40992,back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy
40993,40993,battle the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the
40994,40994,french could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke
40995,40995,was never reliable
40996,40996,the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous
40997,40997,marching at the rate of twentyseven miles a day that they could not
40998,40998,go any faster
40999,40999,to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only
41000,41000,losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and
41001,41001,place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty
41002,41002,thousand
41003,41003,the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our
41004,41004,army as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference
41005,41005,were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind
41006,41006,were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage of
41007,41007,proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army
41008,41008,movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian
41009,41009,our army
41010,41010,another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself
41011,41011,to kutuzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french
41012,41012,troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover
41013,41013,only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag
41014,41014,path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals
41015,41015,whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to
41016,41016,that end kutuzovs activity was directed during the whole campaign
41017,41017,from moscow to vilnanot casually or intermittently but so
41018,41018,consistently that he never once deviated from it
41019,41019,kutuzov felt and knewnot by reasoning or science but with the
41020,41020,whole of his russian beingwhat every russian soldier felt that
41021,41021,out but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the
41022,41022,such a time of the year
41023,41023,and for some reason to capture a king or a dukeit seemed that now
41024,41024,when any battle must be horrible and senselesswas the very time to
41025,41025,fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when
41026,41026,one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with
41027,41027,within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half
41028,41028,they reached the frontier
41029,41029,and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians
41030,41030,stumbled on the french army
41031,41031,french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen
41032,41032,thousand men despite all kutuzovs efforts to avoid that ruinous
41033,41033,of french soldiers by wornout russians continued at krasnoe for three
41034,41034,days
41035,41035,"toll wrote a disposition ""the first column will march to so and"
41036,41036,"not to abandon moscow without a battle"" kutuzov replied ""and i shall"
41037,41037,single russian for ten frenchmen
41038,41038,displeasuresaid in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier
41039,41039,is useless and harmful
41040,41040,nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of
41041,41041,the events his actionswithout the smallest deviationwere all
41042,41042,directed to one and the same threefold end  to brace all his
41043,41043,sufferings of our people and of our army
41044,41044,report directed the commander in chiefs attention to some standards
41045,41045,captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk
41046,41046,regiment
41047,41047,with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him
41048,41048,he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at
41049,41049,him from all sides awaiting a word from him
41050,41050,and closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers
41051,41051,carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in
41052,41052,submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his
41053,41053,surrounded him he looked attentively around at the circle of
41054,41054,the officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words
41055,41055,"were distinctly heard ""i thank you all for your hard and faithful"
41056,41056,service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor
41057,41057,"to you forever"""
41058,41058,he paused and looked around
41059,41059,lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had
41060,41060,accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the
41061,41061,hurrrah roared thousands of voices
41062,41062,while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his
41063,41063,apparently ironic gleam
41064,41064,you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all
41065,41065,at once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no
41066,41066,longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who
41067,41067,wanted to tell his comrades something very important
41068,41068,there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of
41069,41069,going to say
41070,41070,than our poorest beggars while they were strong we didnt spare
41071,41071,fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew
41072,41072,corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased
41073,41073,speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity
41074,41074,and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first
41075,41075,"soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting ""hurrah"""
41076,41076,kutuzovs words were hardly understood by the troops no one could
41077,41077,changing into an old mans simplehearted talk but the hearty
41078,41078,merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found
41079,41079,expression in their joyous and longsustained shouts afterwards
41080,41080,when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished
41081,41081,chapter vii
41082,41082,when the troops reached their nights halting place on the eighth of
41083,41083,growing dusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional
41084,41084,lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the
41085,41085,falling snow a purpleblack and starry sky showed itself and the frost
41086,41086,grew keener
41087,41087,an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong
41088,41088,but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that
41089,41089,night at its halting placea village on the highroad the
41090,41090,quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were
41091,41091,there was only one hut available for the regimental commander
41092,41092,the commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through the
41093,41093,village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts
41094,41094,lair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded kneedeep
41095,41095,section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a
41096,41096,horses a third section scattered through the village arranging
41097,41097,for shelter
41098,41098,some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
41099,41099,was seen swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked
41100,41100,"now then catch hold in twos hand up the lever thats it where
are you shoving to"
41101,41101,now all together but wait a moment boys with a song
41102,41102,"voices roared out at once ""oooooooo thats it all together"
41103,41103,of the men was audible
41104,41104,"here you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a hand
will you you may want us one of these days"
41105,41105,some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into
41106,41106,the gasping men
41107,41107,get along falling what are you stopping for there now
41108,41108,merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely
41109,41109,what are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
41110,41110,sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden
41111,41111,hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back
41112,41112,cant you make less noise
41113,41113,the men became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and
41114,41114,against the wattle
41115,41115,there how that devil hits out hes made my face all bloody said
41116,41116,he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on
41117,41117,tones the men moved forward
41118,41118,when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud
41119,41119,and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day
41120,41120,and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a
41121,41121,him
41122,41122,by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place
41123,41123,flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been
41124,41124,trodden down
41125,41125,axes and choppers were plied all around everything was done without
41126,41126,the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by
41127,41127,stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts
41128,41128,chapter viii
41129,41129,one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
41130,41130,conditions the russian soldiers were in at that timelacking warm
41131,41131,the commissariat did not always keep up with the troopsthey
41132,41132,would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle
41133,41133,conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was
41134,41134,because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were
41135,41135,sifted out of the army day by day all the physically or morally
41136,41136,weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the
41137,41137,armyphysically and mentallyremained
41138,41138,more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company
41139,41139,than anywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and
41140,41140,their campfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by
41141,41141,their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel
41142,41142,"eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you
lost or have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a"
41143,41143,robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they
41144,41144,making the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit
41145,41145,deftly on the spot where he stood
41146,41146,"noticing that the sole of the dancers boot was hanging loose ""what a"
41147,41147,"fellow you are for dancing"""
41148,41148,it on the fire
41149,41149,"and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it
seems said one sergeant major"
41150,41150,ive had an eye on him this long while said the other
41151,41151,well hes a poor sort of soldier
41152,41152,but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday

41446,41446,he was just what he used to be as before he was absentminded and
41447,41447,seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something
41448,41448,special of his own the difference between his former and present self
41449,41449,was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was
41450,41450,seeking to distinguish something at a distance at present he still
41451,41451,forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before
41452,41452,seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was
41453,41453,people had been inclined to avoid him now a smile at the joy of
41454,41454,his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as
41455,41455,conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him
41456,41456,their most intimate secrets
41457,41457,hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him
41458,41458,where she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his
41459,41459,ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse himfelt to her
41460,41460,surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him pierre did
41461,41461,formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and
41462,41462,shown him only the combative side of her nature but now he seemed
41463,41463,the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
41464,41464,showing sympathy with them yet pierres cunning consisted simply in
41465,41465,"yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence
of bad people but of people such as myself thought she"
41466,41466,his servants tooterenty and vaskain their own way noticed the
41467,41467,change that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had
41468,41468,kept him there
41469,41469,well tell me now how did you get food he would ask
41470,41470,out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master
41471,41471,and affection for him
41472,41472,he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every
41473,41473,pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on
41474,41474,ladies
41475,41475,"its a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our
provincials he would say"
41476,41476,fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him
41477,41477,pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially
41478,41478,against napoleon
41479,41479,pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely
41480,41480,by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so
41481,41481,doing
41482,41482,during the last days of pierres stay in orel his old masonic
41483,41483,post in the commissariat department in that town
41484,41484,and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for
41485,41485,one another willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man
41486,41486,but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged
41487,41487,into apathy and egotism
41488,41488,you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said
41489,41489,but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had
41490,41490,think that he had been like that himself but a short time before
41491,41491,they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of
41492,41492,was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon
41493,41493,which gained for him the general good will this was his
41494,41494,acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a mans convictions by
41495,41495,legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and
41496,41496,and gentle smile
41497,41497,in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a
41498,41498,center of gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary
41499,41499,"hopeless agitation and perplexity ""to give or not to give"" he had"
41500,41500,"asked himself ""i have it and he needs it but someone else needs it"
41501,41501,"still more who needs it most and perhaps they are both impostors"""
41502,41502,in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these
41503,41503,surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything
41504,41504,to give formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with
41505,41505,advised one thing and another something else
41506,41506,now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt
41507,41507,or perplexity about these questions there was now within him a
41508,41508,judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should
41509,41509,not be done
41510,41510,felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first
41511,41511,should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children
41512,41512,afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to
41513,41513,appear so insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused
41514,41514,the colonels demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to
41515,41515,some money of which he was evidently in need a further proof to
41516,41516,pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was
41517,41517,furnished by his decision with regard to his wifes debts and to the
41518,41518,rebuilding of his houses in and near moscow
41519,41519,his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him
41520,41520,to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an
41521,41521,estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be
41522,41522,diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes
41523,41523,cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing
41524,41524,yes of course thats true said pierre with a cheerful smile
41525,41525,"i dont need all that at all by being ruined i have become much
richer"
41526,41526,but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account
41527,41527,speaking of this as of a settled matter about the same time he
41528,41528,received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances
41529,41529,speaking of his wifes debts and pierre decided that the stewards
41530,41530,proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to
41531,41531,petersburg and settle his wifes affairs and must rebuild in moscow
41532,41532,felt it must be done
41533,41533,willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together
41534,41534,during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had
41535,41535,journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
41536,41536,had a new significance for him the presence and remarks of
41537,41537,willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia
41538,41538,and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres
41539,41539,pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary
41540,41540,strength and vitalitythe strength which in that vast space amid
41541,41541,people he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree
41542,41542,with himan apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid
41543,41543,discussions that could lead to nothingand he smiled joyfully as he
41544,41544,listened to him
41545,41545,chapter xiv
41546,41546,it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has
41547,41547,been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of
41548,41548,difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of
41549,41549,the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but
41550,41550,intangible yet powerful and indestructible
41551,41551,the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after
41552,41552,at first for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all
41553,41553,had in common a desire to get to the place that had been called
41555,41555,the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of
41556,41556,residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its
41557,41557,plundered it in their turn they continued what the french had
41558,41558,begun trains of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the
41559,41559,villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets
41560,41560,householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it
41561,41561,but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
41562,41562,more difficult and assumed more definite forms
41563,41563,the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations
41564,41564,institutions these forms were lifeless but still existed there
41565,41565,most part still stocked with goodsand there were factories and
41566,41566,plunder
41567,41567,wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but
41568,41568,the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
41569,41569,of the city and its regular life restored
41570,41570,peasantsstreamed into moscow as blood flows to the heart
41571,41571,within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
41572,41572,plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses
41573,41573,down one anothers prices to below what they had been in former
41574,41574,days gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow
41575,41575,cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses the
41576,41576,clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned
41577,41577,donors contributed church property that had been stolen government
41578,41578,clerks set up their baizecovered tables and their pigeonholes of
41579,41579,documents in small rooms the higher authorities and the police
41580,41580,organized the distribution of goods left behind by the french the
41581,41581,the faceted palace in the kremlin others insisted that as the
41582,41582,french had gathered things from different houses into this or that
41583,41583,estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had
41584,41584,wrote proclamations
41585,41585,chapter xv
41586,41586,at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex
41587,41587,of his house which had not been burned he called on count
41588,41588,intended to leave for petersburg two days later everybody was
41589,41589,was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in
41590,41590,any way to all questions put to himwhether important or quite
41591,41591,triflingsuch as where would he live was he going to rebuild
41592,41592,when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel
41593,41593,in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
41594,41594,"before he died"" thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death"
41595,41595,yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the
41596,41596,love he felt for both of them
41597,41597,pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious
41598,41598,mood the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but
41599,41599,a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
41600,41600,of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the
41601,41601,announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre
41602,41602,"yes sir said the man ""please step into the portrait gallery"""
41603,41603,word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he
41604,41604,would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment
41605,41605,in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
41606,41606,another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess
41607,41607,"like he never knew or remembered ""this must be one of her"
41608,41608,"good news we had received for a long time"""
41609,41609,again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
41610,41610,interrupted her
41611,41611,"just imaginei knew nothing about him said he ""i thought he had"
41612,41612,been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only
41613,41613,"know that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence"""
41614,41614,pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the
41615,41615,not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary
41616,41616,still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from pierres
41617,41617,face to that of the lady in the black dress and said
41618,41618,do you really not recognize her
41619,41619,eyes
41620,41620,"looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her"""
41621,41621,that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre
41622,41622,with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even
41623,41623,and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer
41624,41624,been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he
41625,41625,tried to hide his agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more
41626,41626,clearlyclearer than any words could have donedid he betray to
41627,41627,no its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as
41628,41628,soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with
41629,41629,suffused his face and a stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and
41630,41630,fear seized his soul he became confused in his speech and stopped
41631,41631,in the middle of what he was saying
41632,41632,pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect
41633,41633,change in her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin
41634,41634,unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose
41635,41635,now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least
41636,41636,shadow of a smile only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly
41637,41637,interrogative
41638,41638,pierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natashas
41639,41639,whole face
41640,41640,chapter xvi
41641,41641,"she has come to stay with me said princess mary ""the count and"
41642,41642,countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful
41643,41643,state but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor
41644,41644,"they insisted on her coming with me"""
41645,41645,"addressing natasha ""you know it happened the very day we were"
41646,41646,"rescued i saw him what a delightful boy he was"""
41647,41647,widened and lit up
41648,41648,what can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre
41649,41649,nothing why had such a splendid boy so full of life to die
41650,41650,yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith
41651,41651,remarked princess mary
41652,41652,yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her
41653,41653,eyes
41654,41654,"how can you ask why said princess mary ""the thought alone of"
41655,41655,"what awaits"""
41656,41656,natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked
41657,41657,inquiringly at pierre
41658,41658,"is a god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yours"""
41659,41659,natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly
41660,41660,stopped pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed
41661,41661,he felt that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that
41662,41662,there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment
41663,41663,mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world as he
41664,41664,spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on
41665,41665,he was saying he regarded from her standpoint
41666,41666,princess maryreluctantly as is usual in such casesbegan
41667,41667,telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew but
41668,41668,which she feared to recall for her own sake
41669,41669,yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her
41670,41670,he grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always
41671,41671,sought one thingto be perfectly goodso he could not be afraid of
41672,41672,death the faults he hadif he had anywere not of his making so he
41673,41673,"and he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i
entered the room"
41674,41674,her head and began to speak rapidly
41675,41675,breathing quickly
41676,41676,and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she
41677,41677,had never yet mentioned to anyoneall she had lived through during
41678,41678,those three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl
41679,41679,pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full
41680,41680,days of her brothers and natashas love
41681,41681,evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale
41682,41682,several times she repeated the same thing twice
41683,41683,dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
41684,41684,nicholas might come in to say good night
41685,41685,well thats alleverything said natasha
41686,41686,rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow
41687,41687,pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did
41688,41688,not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world
41689,41689,princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his
41690,41690,attention to her nephew who had entered the room
41691,41691,she would not let him go
41692,41692,"no natasha and i sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so
please dont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come
immediately"
41693,41693,"before pierre left the room princess mary told him ""this is the"
41694,41694,"first time she has talked of him like that"""
41695,41695,chapter xvii
41696,41696,minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with
41697,41697,again settled on her face they all three of them now experienced that
41698,41698,feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and
41699,41699,heartfelt talk it is impossible to go back to the same
41700,41700,speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went
41701,41701,silently to table the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up
41702,41702,evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of both shone with
41703,41703,satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy
41704,41704,"suddenly banished the shadows of the past ""now tell us about"
41705,41705,yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to
41706,41706,"him ""they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary"
41707,41707,abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had
41708,41708,instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences in general i have
41709,41709,noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an
41710,41710,interesting man now people invite me out and tell me all about
41711,41711,"myself"""
41712,41712,natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking
41713,41713,"two millions in moscow is that true"""
41714,41714,but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre
41715,41715,though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his
41716,41716,he had become three times as rich as before
41717,41717,and are you building
41718,41718,yes savelich says i must
41719,41719,to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended
41720,41720,"princess mary had given to his words ""i heard of it in orel and you"
41721,41721,and ones own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other
41722,41722,is no longer alive and then such a death without friends and
41723,41723,"told"" said princess mary"
41724,41724,pierre laughed
41725,41725,"no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken
prisoner means being napoleons guest not only did i never see him
but i heard nothing about himi was in much lower company"
41726,41726,captivity was gradually led on to do so
41727,41727,but its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon
41728,41728,"natasha asked with a slight smile ""i guessed it then when we met at"
41729,41729,princess marys questions and especially by natashas into giving a
41730,41730,detailed account of his adventures
41731,41731,at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary
41732,41732,came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
41733,41733,unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
41734,41734,emotion of a man reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions he
41735,41735,has lived through
41736,41736,princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at
41737,41737,natasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his
41738,41738,attention that never wanderedevidently herself experiencing all that
41739,41739,wished to convey it was clear that she understood not only what he
41740,41740,the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman
41741,41741,"for protecting whom he was arrested was this ""it was an awful"

41749,41749,"yes yes go on said natasha ""where is he"""
41750,41750,they killed him almost before my eyes
41751,41751,he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which
41752,41752,a man has when women listen to himnot clever women who when
41753,41753,listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their
41754,41754,it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own
41755,41755,clever comments prepared in their little mental workshopbut the
41756,41756,pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and
41757,41757,absorb the very best a man shows of himself natasha without knowing

41759,41759,all pierres mental travail
41760,41760,now saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the
41761,41761,the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness

41764,41764,understand something more which he had perhaps left untold pierre
41765,41765,tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess
41766,41766,mary was silent it occurred to none of them that it was three oclock

41777,41777,pierre rose and took his leave
41778,41778,princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked
41779,41779,of what pierre had told them princess mary did not express her
41780,41780,opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him
41781,41781,"afraid that by not speaking of him"" she meant prince andrew ""for"
41782,41782,princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice
41783,41783,is it possible to forget said she
41784,41784,"it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard
and painful but good very good said natasha ""i am sure he"
41785,41785,"really loved him that is why i told him was it all right"" she"
41786,41786,to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said
41787,41787,princess mary
41788,41788,do you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous
41789,41789,smile such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long
41790,41790,had just come out of a russian bath do you understand out of a moral
41791,41791,"bath isnt it true"""

41801,41801,it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he

41826,41826,the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than

41829,41829,"i have seen the princess she replied ""i heard that they were"

41847,41847,at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful

41849,41849,"natasha and talked to her ""perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall"
41850,41850,"go in and find no one there"" but he had hardly entered the room"
41851,41851,before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his
41852,41852,sense of freedom she was in the same black dress with soft folds
41853,41853,quite different had she been like this when he entered the day before
41854,41854,he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her
41855,41855,she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince
41856,41856,her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression
41857,41857,but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house
41858,41858,with her
41859,41859,though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their
41860,41860,visitor and though all pierres interest was now centered in that
41861,41861,conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly
41862,41862,broke off he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha
41863,41863,on because he simply could not get up and take his leave
41864,41864,complaining of a headache began to say good night

41866,41866,"and as though offended ""yes no to petersburg tomorrowbut i"
41867,41867,wont say goodby yet i will call round in case you have any
41868,41868,he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands
41869,41869,well he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and
41870,41870,thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be
41871,41871,missing that possibility that possibility is terrible tell
41872,41872,i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary

41874,41874,princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love

41876,41876,wished for
41877,41877,to speak to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the same

41880,41880,pierre was looking into princess marys eyes

tomorrow"
41893,41893,next day pierre came to say goodby natasha was less animated
41894,41894,than she had been the day before but that day as he looked at her
41895,41895,pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor
41896,41896,"goodby count she said aloud ""i shall look forward very much to"
41897,41897,said pierre to himself
41898,41898,chapter xix
41899,41899,there was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled
41900,41900,it during his courtship of helene
41901,41901,he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the
41902,41902,repeated in imagination every word that he or natasha had spoken and
41903,41903,was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had
41904,41904,undertaken was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes
41905,41905,"crossed his mind ""wasnt it all a dream isnt princess mary"
41906,41906,mistaken am i not too conceited and selfconfident i believe all
41907,41907,to smile and say how strange he must be deluding himself doesnt
41908,41908,"altogether different and higher"""
41909,41909,that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now
41910,41910,make any plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable
41911,41911,everything ended with that
41912,41912,but for the whole worldseemed to him centered in his love and the
41913,41913,possibility of being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to
41914,41914,be occupied with one thing onlyhis future happiness sometimes it
41915,41915,seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was
41916,41916,himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be
41917,41917,busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw
41918,41918,allusions to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his
41919,41919,significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a
41920,41920,secret understanding between him and them and when he realized that
41921,41921,whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that
41922,41922,occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention
41923,41923,or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
41924,41924,assumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue
41925,41925,surprise people by his strange comments but at this time he saw
41926,41926,evidently did not understand itin the bright light of the emotion
41927,41927,everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved
41928,41928,memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the
41929,41929,often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity
41930,41930,all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained
41931,41931,views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved
41932,41932,correct
41933,41933,not so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had
41934,41934,"discover personal attributes which he termed ""good qualities"" in"
41935,41935,and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes
41936,41936,for loving them

41938,41938,as if he had come out of a russian bathin a short coat and with

41941,41941,was with natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach
41942,41942,her the reawakened power of life that had seized natasha was so
41943,41943,evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence
41944,41944,princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her
41945,41945,heart
41946,41946, natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling
41947,41947,but bright and cheerful
41948,41948,when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk
41949,41949,he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated
41950,41950,and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness
41951,41951,for her joy settled on natashas face
41952,41952,i wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me
41953,41953,understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed

41956,41956,and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that

41958,41958,was astounded
41959,41959,to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand
41960,41960,but noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she
41961,41961,guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry
41962,41962,you love him

41999,41999,selfdeception inseparable from power a character who at every moment
42000,42000,of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in

42047,42047,of that movement from east to west
42048,42048,what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with

42050,42050,with him a mild and attractive personality and a personal
42051,42051,grievance against napoleon and all this was found in alexander i all

42053,42053,during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed

42059,42059,about the welfare of his peoplesat the time when napoleon in exile
42060,42060,was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made

the rest of you let me live like a man and think of my soul and of

42074,42074,all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee

42140,42140,commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all
42141,42141,one pipe after another he seemed carefully to cherish within

42149,42149,nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess
42150,42150,any more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several
42151,42151,times a day
42152,42152,when she began to talk about her
42153,42153,nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the
42154,42154,"and you must go and call on her you would at least be seeing
somebody and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us"
42155,42155,but i dont in the least want to mamma
42156,42156,"you used to want to and now you dont really i dont understand
you my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see
anyone"
42157,42157,but i never said i was dull
42158,42158,"why you said yourself you dont want even to see her she is a
very admirable young woman and you always liked her but now
suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head you hide
everything from me"
42159,42159,not at all mamma
42160,42160,"if i were asking you to do something disagreeable nowbut i only
ask you to return a call one would think mere politeness required
it well i have asked you and now i wont interfere any more
since you have secrets from your mother"
42161,42161,well then ill go if you wish it
42162,42162,it doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sake
42163,42163,the day after that

42168,42168,but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling
42169,42169,akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she
42170,42170,had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the
42171,42171,express his feeling for her she knew that but it concealed

42177,42177,goodby
42178,42178,with mademoiselle bouriennes help the princess had maintained the
42179,42179,her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so
42180,42180,that he had risen
42181,42181,looked at the princess she still sat motionless with a look of
42182,42182,suffering on her gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for her and was
42183,42183,vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
42184,42184,think of nothing to say
42185,42185,goodby princess said he
42186,42186,"oh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up ""are you going"

42192,42192,ones as he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden
42193,42193,meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her

42195,42195,"i cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly ""on the"

42198,42198,his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but the
42199,42199,and it was to him that she now spoke
42200,42200,"i thought you would allow me to tell you this she said ""i had"
42201,42201,come so near to you and to all your family that i thought you would

42209,42209,"eyes and in her voice ""i have had so little happiness in life that"

42211,42211,princess
42212,42212,she turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one
42213,42213,anothers eyesand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly
42214,42214,chapter vii
42215,42215,in the winter of  nicholas married princess mary and moved to
42216,42216,within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
42217,42217,inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as
42218,42218,well
42219,42219,that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was
42220,42220,negotiating to buy back otradnoethat being his pet dream
42221,42221,that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas
42222,42222,english ones then coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical
42223,42223,make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate he
42224,42224,always had before his minds eye the estate as a whole and not any
42225,42225,particular part of it the chief thing in his eyes was not the
42226,42226,when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its
42227,42227,and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality
42228,42228,judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the
42229,42229,toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management
42230,42230,produced very brilliant results
42231,42231,the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he
42232,42232,allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he
42233,42233,get them expelled from the commune
42234,42234,he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and
42235,42235,nicholas
42236,42236,he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsthe
42237,42237,drones as he called themand everyone said he spoiled them by his
42238,42238,consulted everybody in the house but when it was possible to have a
42239,42239,domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without
42240,42240,the least hesitation he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the
42241,42241,peasants he knew that his every decision would be approved by them
42242,42242,all with very few exceptions
42243,42243,to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he
42244,42244,definite in his own mind
42245,42245,"would say ""what can one do with our russian peasants"" and imagined"
42246,42246,that he could not bear them
42247,42247,"yet he loved ""our russian peasants"" and their way of life with his"
42248,42248,the one way and manner of farming which produced good results
42249,42249,countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and
42250,42250,regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand
42251,42251,and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly
42252,42252,from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her she did not
42253,42253,understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the
42254,42254,with his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his
42255,42255,nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his
42256,42256,harvest in she did not understand why he stepped out from the
42257,42257,window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so
42258,42258,threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the
42259,42259,"well one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under
cover"
42260,42260,brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed
42261,42261,passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed
42262,42262,least it never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good
42263,42263,thats all poetry and old wives talkall that doing good to ones
42264,42264,neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go
42265,42265,"for me"""
42266,42266,and all nicholas did was fruitfulprobably just because he
42267,42267,refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for
42268,42268,virtues sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring
42269,42269,memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs
42270,42270,"he was a master the peasants affairs first and then his own of
course he was not to be trifled with eitherin a word he was a
real master"
42271,42271,chapter viii
42272,42272,and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of
42273,42273,making free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in
42274,42274,of punishment suddenly changed
42275,42275,man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused
42276,42276,of dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the

42278,42278,been doing that morning among other things he spoke of the
42279,42279,continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her
42280,42280,husband no reply

42282,42282,down again and her lips puckered
42283,42283,why whatever is the matter my dearest
42284,42284,the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in
42285,42285,charm
42286,42286,the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain
42287,42287,herself and began to cry
42288,42288,nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas
42289,42289,and she covered her face with her hands
42290,42290,paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping
42291,42291,he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong
42292,42292,is it just sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he
42293,42293,asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her
42294,42294,was right and that he had long been sinning against himself
42295,42295,of laocoons head
42296,42296,todayit was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it

42299,42299,among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not
42300,42300,and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid
42301,42301,the work on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the
42302,42302,with his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his
42303,42303,afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and
42304,42304,making himself one with his family and entering into all the details
42305,42305,of his childrens relations with their mother the harmony between him
42306,42306,and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh

42309,42309,mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized
42310,42310,imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could
42311,42311,but often felt illwill toward her which she could not overcome
42312,42312,once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about
42313,42313,her own injustice toward her
42314,42314,"there is a passage in them that just fits sonya"""
42315,42315,"to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not
shall be taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i
dont know perhaps she lacks egotism i dont know but from her is
taken away and everything has been taken away sometimes i am
dreadfully sorry for her formerly i very much wanted nicholas to
marry her but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not
come off she is a sterile flower you knowlike some strawberry
blossoms sometimes i am sorry for her and sometimes i think she
doesnt feel it as you or i would"
42316,42316,though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel
42317,42317,natashas explanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her
42318,42318,sterile flower she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of

42320,42320,same scale as under the old prince
42321,42321,than simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of
42322,42322,their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was

42337,42337,precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the

42343,42343,she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had
42344,42344,his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there
42345,42345,was no cause for his illhumor but today she quite forgot that and
42346,42346,she felt unhappy she asked him where he had been he replied she
42347,42347,again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm her
42348,42348,unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily
42349,42349,"then im not mistaken thought countess mary ""why is he cross"
42350,42350,"with me"" she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and"
42351,42351,wished to end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded
42352,42352,thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general
42353,42353,angry with her
42354,42354,"you always have such strange fancies i didnt even think of
being angry he replied"
42355,42355,"wont tell you why"""
42356,42356,nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya

42358,42358,well messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with
42359,42359,apparent cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on
42360,42360,and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room
42361,42361,and lay down on the sofa
42362,42362,"thats always the way thought countess mary ""he talks to"
42363,42363,"especially when i am in this condition"" she looked down at her"
42364,42364,in which her eyes now looked larger than ever
42365,42365,sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling
42366,42366,irritated
42367,42367,having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything

42370,42370,chairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with
42371,42371,perhaps he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she
42372,42372,meeting her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that
42373,42373,"she crossed her path everywhere ""andrew may wake him"""
42374,42374,evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made
42375,42375,her quietly and went to the door sonya went away by another door
42376,42376,from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his
42377,42377,wife as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome
42378,42378,it in the stillness of the night when he slept nicholas suddenly
42379,42379,moved and cleared his throat and at that moment little andrew shouted
42380,42380,"from outside the door ""papa mammas standing here"" countess mary"
42381,42381,nicholas disliked being waked then through the door she heard

bring him here"
42384,42384,i only came in to look and did not notice forgive me
42385,42385,nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the
42386,42386,door and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little
42387,42387,from her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting
42388,42388,tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head nicholas turned

42395,42395,she went in and sat down by her husband
42396,42396,"i did not notice him following me she said timidly ""i just"
42397,42397,"looked in"""
42398,42398,kissed her hair
42399,42399,may i kiss mamma he asked natasha
42400,42400,natasha smiled bashfully
42401,42401,spot where nicholas had placed the kiss
42402,42402,to the question he knew was in his wifes mind
42403,42403,"you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are
like that it always seems to me "
42404,42404,mary dont talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he
42405,42405,said gaily
42406,42406,"it seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain
always and now in this cond"
42407,42407,"oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears its love
that makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind
who are loved for their beauty but do i love my wife i dont love
her but i dont know how to put it without you or when something
comes between us like this i seem lost and cant do anything now
do i love my finger i dont love it but just try to cut it off"
42408,42408,"im not like that myself but i understand so youre not angry
with me"
42409,42409,his hair he began to pace the room
42410,42410,immediately thinking aloud in his wifes presence now that they had
42411,42411,made it up
42412,42412,he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a
42413,42413,thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he
42414,42414,told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till
42415,42415,spring
42416,42416,in her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the
42417,42417,children
42418,42418,"to little natasha ""you reproach us women with being illogical here"
42419,42419,happiness on the faces of both father and daughter
42420,42420,but you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one
42421,42421,his wife whispered in french
42422,42422,yes but what am i to do i try not to show
42423,42423,at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps
42424,42424,somebody has come
42425,42425,i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary
42426,42426,and left the room
42427,42427,in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little
42428,42428,laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart
42429,42429,happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was
42430,42430,as his old father had danced daniel cooper with his daughter
42431,42431,"the room a few minutes later ""now our natasha has come to life you"
42432,42432,should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was
42433,42433,before he became her husband natasha on the contrary had at once
42434,42434,powerful part she gave it up just because it was so powerfully
42435,42435,exacting she acted in contradiction to all those rules she felt that
42436,42436,the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be
42437,42437,with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had
42438,42438,the bond between her own body and soul
42439,42439,romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange
42440,42440,as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others
42441,42441,might perhaps have been agreeableshe did not knowbut she had no
42442,42442,time at all for it the chief reason for devoting no time either to
42443,42443,time to spare for these things
42444,42444,we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed
42445,42445,so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones
42446,42446,entire attention is devoted to it
42447,42447,the subject which wholly engrossed natashas attention was her
42448,42448,larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did
42449,42449,thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered
42450,42450,necessary
42451,42451,there were then as now conversations and discussions about womens
42452,42452,she positively did not understand them
42453,42453,which lies in the family
42454,42454,did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of
42455,42455,a dinner is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is
42456,42456,the family
42457,42457,two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain
42458,42458,that case will not have a family
42459,42459,if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is
42460,42460,needed a husband a husband was given her and he gave her a family
42461,42461,all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and
42462,42462,it would be if things were different
42463,42463,with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys
42464,42464,that baby was much better
42465,42465,to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she
42466,42466,or plainwere habitual subjects of jest to those about her the
42467,42467,was really true from the very first days of their married life
42468,42468,natasha had announced her demands pierre was greatly surprised by his
42469,42469,life belonged to her and to the family his wifes demands
42470,42470,pierres subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
42471,42471,which she did not in the least understand but to which she
42472,42472,the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as
42473,42473,he chose at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to
42474,42474,to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done
42475,42475,always he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and
42476,42476,run to fulfill it
42477,42477,the entire household was governed according to pierres supposed
42478,42478,natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his
42479,42479,wishes to be and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite
42480,42480,tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would
42481,42481,fight him with his own weapons

42484,42484,her husband himselfwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing
42485,42485,babies herself
42486,42486,it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and
42487,42487,surprise and delight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the
42488,42488,everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had
42489,42489,added when expressing his opinion
42490,42490,after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm
42491,42491,saw himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within
42492,42492,himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really
42493,42493,rejected and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a
42494,42494,direct and mysterious reflection

42498,42498,being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the
42499,42499,principal founders
42500,42500,on reading that letter she always read her husbands letters
42501,42501,she would feel his absence very acutely she attributed immense
42502,42502,importance to all her husbands intellectual and abstract interests
42503,42503,hindrance to him in such matters to pierres timid look of inquiry
42504,42504,definite date for his return he was given four weeks leave of
42505,42505,absence
42506,42506,fortnight he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad
42507,42507,and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former
42508,42508,enchantress
42509,42509,console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay
42510,42510,in returning
42511,42511,"its all nonsense all rubbishthose discussions which lead to
nothing and all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very"
42512,42512,affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed
42513,42513,else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
42514,42514,little threemonthold creature when he lay at her breast and she
42515,42515,was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his
42516,42516,"he"" and that was unanswerable it was more than true"
42517,42517,during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for
42518,42518,just what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety
42519,42519,about her husband more easily
42520,42520,she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was
42521,42521,her mistressentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a
42522,42522,beaming face
42523,42523,lest she should rouse the dozing baby
42524,42524,hes come maam whispered the nurse
42525,42525,but she could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his
42526,42526,again lazily smacked his lips
42527,42527,but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for
42528,42528,the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of
42529,42529,his cot
42530,42530,kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress
42531,42531,natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom
42532,42532,returned
42533,42533,on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
42534,42534,"unwinding his scarf ""its he its really he he has come"" she"
42535,42535,"contented"""
42536,42536,then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
42537,42537,face vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of
42538,42538,reproaches and angry words
42539,42539,"yes its all very well for you you are pleased youve had a good
time but what about me you might at least have shown
consideration for the children i am nursing and my milk was
spoiled petya was at deaths door but you were enjoying yourself
yes enjoying"
42540,42540,sooner he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a
42541,42541,minute or two above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy
42542,42542,he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so he made a
42543,42543,i could not on my honor but how is petya
42544,42544,"all right now come along i wonder youre not ashamed if only you
could see what i was like without you how i suffered"
42545,42545,you are well
42546,42546,to their rooms
42547,42547,when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the
42548,42548,palm and dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the babys
42549,42549,broad face with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since
42550,42550,gazed tenderly at her husband and child
42551,42551,and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore she
42552,42552,asked
42553,42553,yes capitally
42554,42554,"you see he holds it up she meant the babys head ""but how"
42555,42555,he did frighten me youve seen the princess is it true shes in
42556,42556,"love with that"""
42557,42557,yes just fancy
42558,42558,at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the
42559,42559,baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all
42560,42560,his attention
42561,42561,understand how it is you dont see the charm of these delicious
42562,42562,"marvels"""
42563,42563,a lump of flesh come along pierre

42565,42565,"hand is just made for a babys seat just look"""
42566,42566,shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse
42567,42567,chapter xii
42568,42568,though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the
42569,42569,reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the
42570,42570,others
42571,42571,they all felt it to be so
42572,42572,the servantsthe most reliable judges of their masters because they
42573,42573,judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
42574,42574,acts and way of lifewere glad of pierres return because they knew
42575,42575,that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day
42576,42576,and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the
42577,42577,holidays
42578,42578,the children and their governesses were glad of pierres return
42579,42579,because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as
42580,42580,he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only
42581,42581,and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all
42582,42582,because uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his
42583,42583,rapturous and passionate affection no one had instilled into him this
42584,42584,love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had
42585,42585,brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she
42586,42586,not want to be an hussar or a knight of st george like his uncle
42587,42587,pierres presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed
42588,42588,and was breathless when pierre spoke to him he did not miss a
42589,42589,said pierres past life and his unhappiness prior to  of which
42590,42590,young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he
42591,42591,pierres friendship with the father whom nicholas could not
42592,42592,rememberall this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint
42593,42593,his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his
42594,42594,friend but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a
42595,42595,without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture so the
42596,42596,boy also was happy that pierre had arrived
42597,42597,the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and
42598,42598,unite any company he was in
42599,42599,pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more
42600,42600,smoothly and peacefully
42601,42601,especially that natasha would now be herself again
42602,42602,pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and
42603,42603,made haste to satisfy all their expectations
42604,42604,in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that
42605,42605,his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things
42606,42606,annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything but in time
42607,42607,he grew used to this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for
42608,42608,childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the
42609,42609,it was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other
42610,42610,stinginess
42611,42611,from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing
42612,42612,had begun to improve
42613,42613,life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive
42614,42614,longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had
42615,42615,now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not
42616,42616,like a shopman
42617,42617,things he showed her
42618,42618,thats for belova excellent she felt the quality of the
42619,42619,pierre told her the price
42620,42620,"too dear natasha remarked ""how pleased the children will be"
42621,42621,"when i take little masha into society perhaps they will be
fashionable again by then well lets go now"
42622,42622,and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and
42623,42623,then to the old countess rooms
42624,42624,room with parcels under their arms
42625,42625,she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
42626,42626,only death could give her but until death came she had to go on
42627,42627,very young children and very old people was particularly evident in
42628,42628,her her life had no external aimsonly a need to exercise her
42629,42629,liver she did these things not under any external impulse as people
42630,42630,strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she
42631,42631,talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and
42632,42632,was for her evidently merely a pretext
42633,42633,thus in the morningespecially if she had eaten anything rich the
42634,42634,day beforeshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the
42635,42635,handiest pretext belovas deafness
42636,42636,she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other
42637,42637,end of the room
42638,42638,it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur
42639,42639,too damp or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability
42640,42640,countess face yellow just as she needed to work off her spleen so
42641,42641,she had sometimes to exercise her stillexisting faculty of
42642,42642,thinkingand the pretext for that was a game of patience when she
42643,42643,usually toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinner rest
42644,42644,stories over and over again to the same audience
42645,42645,the old ladys condition was understood by the whole household
42646,42646,effort to satisfy her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a
42647,42647,common understanding of her condition expressed
42648,42648,but those glances expressed something more they said that she had
42649,42649,that she was not pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it
42650,42650,diverted her attention from the unfinished game
42651,42651,she finished her game of patience and only then examined the
42652,42652,portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in
42653,42653,did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the
42654,42654,portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards
42655,42655,thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she always
42656,42656,"did ""but best of all you have brought yourself backfor i never"
42657,42657,we to do with her she is like a mad woman when you are away
42658,42658,belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress
42659,42659,material
42660,42660,much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old
42661,42661,dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to
42662,42662,converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune
42663,42663,questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times
42664,42664,again be unable to rememberyet they sat at tea round the samovar
42665,42665,questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess
42666,42666,matters that interested no one and to which she herself was
42667,42667,indifferent
42668,42668,continued all through teatime all the grownup members of the
42669,42669,family were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided
42670,42670,beside the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had
42671,42671,had tea and their voices were audible from the next room at tea all
42672,42672,sat in their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small
42673,42673,tunic unbuttoned pierre sat between his wife and the old countess he
42674,42674,spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could
42675,42675,understand he told her of external social events and of the people
42676,42676,who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a
42677,42677,scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last
42678,42678,ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years but to the old
42679,42679,countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious
42680,42680,and real society natasha saw by pierres animation that his visit had
42681,42681,been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it
42682,42682,nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince
42683,42683,ivan and countess mary alexeevna

42687,42687,"is the whole government now"""
42688,42688,finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry

42691,42691,"they say"""

42694,42694,"well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most
estimable man i used to meet him at mary antonovnas said the"
42695,42695,countess in an offended tone and still more offended that they all
42696,42696,everybody else got up too and with a severe expression sailed back
42697,42697,to her table in the sitting room
42698,42698,the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
42699,42699,childrens voices and laughter from the next room evidently some
42700,42700,jolly excitement was going on there
42701,42701,finished finished little natashas gleeful yell rose above
42702,42702,them all

42704,42704,never lost sight of and smiled happily
42705,42705,thats delightful music said he
42706,42706,it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said
42707,42707,countess mary

42713,42713,still louder
42714,42714,three and a rapturously breathless cry of childrens voices
42715,42715,herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same
42716,42716,chapter xiv
42717,42717,soon after this the children came in to say good night they
42718,42718,they went out only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles
42719,42719,whispered to the boy to come downstairs
42720,42720,no monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay replied
42721,42721,nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper
42722,42722,glanced at him and turned to pierre
42723,42723,when you are here he cant tear himself away she said
42724,42724,"to young nicholas with a smile ""you and i havent seen anything of"

42727,42727,natasha did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov
42728,42728,sonyawho sat weary but resolute at the samovarand questioned
42729,42729,the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in
42730,42730,sharp comments on what pierre told them
42731,42731,"one used to have to be a germannow one must dance with tatawinova
and madame kwudener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh they
should let that fine fellow bonaparte losehed knock all this
nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment
to a fellow like that schwatz he cried"
42732,42732,to him very important and so he thought it necessary to take an
42733,42733,interest in these things and to question pierre the questions put
42734,42734,by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary
42735,42735,character of gossip about the higher government circles
42736,42736,had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation
42737,42737,to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake
42738,42738,of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend
42739,42739,prince theodore had gone
42740,42740,what was it about asked nicholas
42741,42741,"listeners ""everybody sees that things are going so badly that they"
42742,42742,cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent
42743,42743,"men to counteract it as far as they can"""
42744,42744,what can be done
42745,42745,why this
42746,42746,come into my study said nicholas
42747,42747,now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary
42748,42748,followed her the men went into the study and little nicholas
42749,42749,bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the
42750,42750,writing table in a shady corner by the window
42751,42751,well what would you do asked denisov
42752,42752,always some fantastic schemes said nicholas
42753,42753,petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has
42754,42754,"abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism"" pierre could not"
42755,42755,only these people sans foi ni loi can give it himpeople who
42756,42756,and tutti quanti you will agree that if you did not look after
42757,42757,"well everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in
the army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the
people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young
and honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on
everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break"
42758,42758,said pierre as those who examine the actions of any government have
42759,42759,"always said since governments began ""i told them just one thing in"
42760,42760,"petersburg"""
42761,42761,told whom
42762,42762,"his brows ""prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and"
42763,42763,philanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in
42764,42764,"the present circumstances something else is needed"""
42765,42765,at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face
42766,42766,darkened and he went up to the boy
42767,42767,why are you here
42768,42768,needed when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at
42769,42769,as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to
42770,42770,withstand the general calamity everything that is young and strong is
42771,42771,"but independence and action as well"""
42772,42772,discontentedly and frowning more and more
42773,42773,"but action with what aim he cried ""and what position will you"
42774,42774,"adopt toward the government"""
42775,42775,"why the position of assistants the society need not be secret
if the government allows it not merely is it not hostile to
government but it is a society of true conservativesa society of
gentlemen in the full meaning of that word it is only to prevent some
pugachev or other from killing my children and yours and arakcheev
from sending me off to some military settlement we join hands only
for the public welfare and the general safety"
42776,42776,"yes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and
harmful one which can only cause harm"
42777,42777,why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then
42778,42778,"venture to suggest that russia had saved europe ""do any harm the"
42779,42779,"is what christ preached on the cross"""
42780,42780,her husband it was not what he was saying that pleased herthat
42781,42781,simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her
42782,42782,was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad
42783,42783,the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turndown collar
42784,42784,whom everyone had forgottengazed at pierre with even greater and
42785,42785,and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke
42786,42786,the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles
42787,42787,table
42788,42788,"it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german
tugendbund was and what i am proposing"
42789,42789,"no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage
eaters but i dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it"
42790,42790,"interposed denisov in a loud and resolute voice ""i agwee that"
42791,42791,"thats all wight je suis vote homme"""
42792,42792,"""im your man"""
42793,42793,brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no
42794,42794,prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of
42795,42795,"abandoning the attempt ""i cant prove it to you you say that"
42796,42796,everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont see
42797,42797,it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
42798,42798,if you formed a secret society and began working against the
42799,42799,governmentbe it what it mayi know it is my duty to obey the
42800,42800,government and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
42801,42801,"and you may argue about that as you like"""
42802,42802,an awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to
42803,42803,was weak and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was
42804,42804,last remark
42805,42805,"uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree
with you he asked"
42806,42806,and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in
42807,42807,give him an answer
42808,42808,the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what
42809,42809,he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to
42810,42810,nicholas
42811,42811,pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens
42812,42812,nicholas started angrily
42813,42813,away from the boy
42814,42814,you ought not to have been here at all he said
42815,42815,chapter xv
42816,42816,but turned on the subject nicholas liked bestrecollections of
42817,42817, denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable
42818,42818,and amusing about them the family separated on the most friendly
42819,42819,terms
42820,42820,what are you writing mary nicholas asked
42821,42821,countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing
42822,42822,would not be understood or approved by her husband
42823,42823,the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would
42824,42824,now have to tell him
42825,42825,the book
42826,42826,it was in french
42827,42827,december  today when andrusha her eldest boy woke up he did
42828,42828,not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was
42829,42829,i took the matter in hand i left him alone and began with nurses
42830,42830,calm him for a long time it was plain that what troubled him most was
42831,42831,that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him
42832,42832,anything with him by tenderness
42833,42833,what is a ticket nicholas inquired
42834,42834,"i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how
they have behaved"
42835,42835,continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down
42836,42836,everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their
42837,42837,mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
42838,42838,on educational methods they were for the most part quite
42839,42839,the first time

42844,42844,nicholas this
42845,42845,nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant
42846,42846,eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her
42847,42847,diary there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of
42848,42848,his admiration for his wife
42849,42849,which the sole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had
42850,42850,nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that
42851,42851,more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part
42852,42852,of himself
42853,42853,i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant
42854,42854,you werent in the study we began disputingpierre and iand i lost

42858,42858,"yes i know said countess mary ""natasha told me"""
42859,42859,oath of allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they
42860,42860,all fell on medenisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she
42861,42861,rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no
42862,42862,yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge
42863,42863,those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying
42864,42864,about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in
42865,42865,relation to his wife
42866,42866,yes i have noticed that said countess mary
42867,42867,"when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he
started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not therewhat
would you have said"
42868,42868,"as i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre
says everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that
it is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there"
42869,42869,"expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children"""
42870,42870,"who fancied he really had said it ""but they insisted on their own"

doing for him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine
lad this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and
fancyas we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken
everything on my table to bits and he told me of it himself at
once i never knew him to tell an untruth a fine lad a fine lad"

42886,42886,countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread

42888,42888,she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do
42889,42889,so she only took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of
42890,42890,minutes reflection continued to think aloud
42891,42891,you know mary today elias mitrofanych this was his overseer
42892,42892,"came back from the tambov estate and told me they are already
offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest"
42893,42893,and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
42894,42894,"life and i shall leave the children in an excellent position"""
42895,42895,countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he
42896,42896,told her she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would
42897,42897,noticed that she had been thinking about something else but she had
42898,42898,something different she felt a submissive tender love for this man
42899,42899,make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate
42900,42900,tenderness besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and
42901,42901,thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted
42902,42902,through her mind she thought of her nephew her husbands account
42903,42903,of the boys agitation while pierre was speaking struck her
42904,42904,recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she thought
42905,42905,with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for
42906,42906,young nicholas
42907,42907,sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
42908,42908,promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible
42909,42909,and could therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the
42910,42910,"face nicholas gazed at her ""o god what will become of us if she"
42911,42911,placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers
42912,42912,chapter xvi
42913,42913,understanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to
42914,42914,and in a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of
42915,42915,talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something
42916,42916,being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical
42917,42917,from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with
42918,42918,and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked
42919,42919,about at one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many
42920,42920,topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was
42921,42921,the surest sign that they fully understood one another
42922,42922,were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted
42923,42923,them
42924,42924,better than herself in saying this natasha was sincere in
42925,42925,been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg

42928,42928,"mary is so splendid she said ""how she understands children it"
42929,42929,"mitya was naughty"""
42930,42930,how like his father he is pierre interjected
42931,42931,natasha knew why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas the
42932,42932,recollection of his dispute with his brotherinlaw was unpleasant and
42933,42933,he wanted to know what natasha thought of it
42934,42934,collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till
42935,42935,he has read what he had already boughtsismondi and rousseau and
42936,42936,to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show
42937,42937,that this was unnecessary
42938,42938,so you say ideas are an amusement to him
42939,42939,"yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg
i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all
else is mere amusement"
42940,42940,ah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said
42941,42941,"nicholas says we ought not to think but i cant help it besides
when i was in petersburg i felt i can this to you that the whole
affair would go to pieces without meeveryone was pulling his own
way but i succeeded in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear
and simple you see i dont say that we ought to oppose this and
that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the
right and let there be but one bannerthat of active virtue prince
sergey is a fine fellow and clever"
42942,42942,natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres
42943,42943,"necessary to society be also my husband how did this happen"" she"
42944,42944,"wished to express this doubt to him ""now who could decide whether"
42945,42945,passed in review all those whom pierre most respected judging by what

42947,42947,karataev
42948,42948,"do you know what i am thinking about she asked ""about platon"
42949,42949,pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood
42950,42950,his wifes line of thought
42951,42951,"trying to imagine karataevs opinion on the subject ""he would not"
42952,42952,"have understood yet perhaps he would"""
42953,42953,"what he would have approved of is our family life he was always so
anxious to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and
i should have been proud to let him see us there nowyou talk of
my absence but you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for
you after a separation"
42954,42954,yes i should think natasha began
42955,42955,"no its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt
love more but this is something special yes of course he did"
42956,42956,not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest
42957,42957,you remember how we quarreled and it was always my fault always
42958,42958,"mine and what we quarreled abouti dont even remember"""
42959,42959,"always about the same thing said pierre with a smile ""jealo"""
42960,42960,a pause
42961,42961,no and if i had i shouldnt have recognized her
42962,42962,they were silent for a while

42964,42964,"him the milks come but im sorry to leave you"""
42965,42965,they were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one
42966,42966,another at the same time they both began to speak pierre began with
42967,42967,having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
42968,42968,continue
42969,42969,no what did you say go on go on
42970,42970,no you go on i was talking nonsense said natasha
42971,42971,pierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to his
42972,42972,complacent reflections on his success in petersburg at that moment it
42973,42973,seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the
42974,42974,whole of russian society and to the whole world
42975,42975,"i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are
always simple ones my whole idea is that if vicious people are united
and constitute a power then honest folk must do the same now
thats simple enough"
42976,42976,yes
42977,42977,and what were you going to say
42978,42978,i only nonsense
42979,42979,but all the same
42980,42980,"brightly ""i only wanted to tell you about petya today nurse was"
42981,42981,meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonskis bedroom a
42982,42982,little lamp was burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark
42983,42983,and they could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four
42984,42984,pillows and his roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring
42985,42985,up in bed and gazed before him with wideopen eyes he had awaked from
42986,42986,army the army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air
42987,42987,like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which dessalles called
42988,42988,those threads but rather thicker he and pierre were borne along
42989,42989,threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it
42990,42990,grew difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood before them in a
42991,42991,stern and threatening attitude
42992,42992,"the first of you who moves forward"" little nicholas turned to look at"
42993,42993,pierre but pierre was no longer there in his place was his father
42994,42994,caressed and pitied him but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer
42995,42995,to them terror seized young nicholas and he awoke
42996,42996,my father he thought though there were two good portraits of
42997,42997,"form ""my father has been with me and caressed me he approved of"
42998,42998,mucius scaevola burned his hand why should not the same sort of thing
42999,42999,happen to me i know they want me to learn and i will learn but
43000,43000,something i only pray god that something may happen to me such as
43001,43001,and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry
43002,43002,are you ill he heard dessalles voice asking
43003,43003,he is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles
43004,43004,"but uncle pierre oh what a wonderful man he is and my father
oh father father yes i will do something with which even he
would be satisfied"
43005,43005,second epilogue
43006,43006,chapter i
43007,43007,history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put
43008,43008,the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to
43009,43009,describe and seize the apparently elusivethe life of a people
43010,43010,regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the
43011,43011,whole nation
43012,43012,the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished
43013,43013,and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the
43014,43014,ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations
43015,43015,as to accomplish ends that were predestined
43016,43016,for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the
43017,43017,direct participation of the deity in human affairs
43018,43018,it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in
43019,43019,mans subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward
43020,43020,manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern
43021,43021,history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held
43022,43022,instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided
43023,43023,small northwesterly portion of a large continent
43024,43024,modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
43025,43025,which these nations and humanity at large are tending
43026,43026,at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon
43027,43027,in the first place the historian describes the activity of
43028,43028,individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian
43029,43029,which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them
43030,43030,of a small corner of the world called europe
43031,43031,expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it
43032,43032,moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east
43033,43033,middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of
43034,43034,the first movement in the westparisand subsides
43035,43035,during that twentyyear period an immense number of fields were left
43036,43036,christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
43037,43037,another
43038,43038,what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people
43039,43039,burn houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these
43040,43040,encounters the monuments and tradition of that period
43041,43041,for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns
43042,43042,to know themselves
43043,43043,if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
43044,43044,believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the
43045,43045,but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit
43046,43046,the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the
43047,43047,answers
43048,43048,modern history replying to these questions says you want to know
43049,43049,these events then listen
43050,43050,"louis xiv was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such
and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france
badly his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france
badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such
mistresses moreover certain men wrote some books at that time at
the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men
in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this
caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one
another they killed the king and many other people at that time
there was in france a man of geniusnapoleon he conquered
everybody everywherethat is he killed many people because he was
a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and
killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he
returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all
obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill
people in italy austria and prussia and there too he killed a great
many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to
restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in 
he suddenly made friends with him but in  they again quarreled
and again began killing many people napoleon led six hundred thousand
men into russia and captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from
moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and
others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all
napoleons allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces
advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated
napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him
to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and
showing him every respect though five years before and one year later
they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii
who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the
allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old
guards renounced the throne and went into exile then the skillful
statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to
sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended
the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations
made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and
monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering
their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in
france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him
immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry
at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated
the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent
him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the
beloved france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that
rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a
reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress
their subjects"
43051,43051,it would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature
43052,43052,of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild
43053,43053,histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and
43054,43054,the new histories of the culture of that period
43055,43055,the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact
43056,43056,asked
43057,43057,if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement
43058,43058,of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is
43059,43059,is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we
43060,43060,recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently
43061,43061,connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations
43062,43062,interest of history lies precisely in that force
43063,43063,history seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to
43064,43064,reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
43065,43065,quite well known to everybody
43066,43066,chapter ii
43067,43067,what force moves the nations
43068,43068,biographical historians and historians of separate nations
43069,43069,understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in
43070,43070,given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes
43071,43071,events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one
43072,43072,historian to each event as soon as historians of different
43073,43073,understood by them all not only differently but often in quite
43074,43074,contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by
43075,43075,historians of that kind contradict each other even in their
43076,43076,statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular
43077,43077,based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians
43078,43078,reply to historys essential question
43079,43079,writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
43080,43080,recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the
43081,43081,force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power
43082,43082,multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war or
43083,43083,many persons connected with the event
43084,43084,most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power
43085,43085,plainly say that the campaign of  and other things they do not
43086,43086,that the very ideas of  were arrested in their development by
43087,43087,napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper
43088,43088,of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons power
43089,43089,suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the
43090,43090,age
43091,43091,this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur
43092,43092,up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs
43093,43093,because after entering the field of analysis the universal
43094,43094,historians stop halfway
43095,43095,to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant
43096,43096,resultant action
43097,43097,specialist historians describing the campaign of  or the
43098,43098,restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were
43099,43099,produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian
43100,43100,to prove that the campaign of  and the restoration of the bourbons
43101,43101,were due to other things beside alexanders willsuch as the activity
43102,43102,millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that
43103,43103,one another only affected their mutual relations but does not
43104,43104,account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how
43105,43105,from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people
43106,43106,resultant equal to a thousand times athe historian is again
43107,43107,obliged to fall back on powerthe force he had deniedand to
43108,43108,admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just
43109,43109,contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves
43110,43110,"to whether they want rain or fine weather ""the wind has blown the"
43111,43111,power produces events
43112,43112,a third class of historiansthe socalled historians of culture
43113,43113,following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes
43114,43114,accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsagain take
43115,43115,that force to be something quite different they see it in what is
43116,43116,called culturein mental activity
43117,43117,the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
43118,43118,events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
43119,43119,such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense
43120,43120,historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that
43121,43121,this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove
43122,43122,great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between
43123,43123,for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders
43124,43124,of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality
43125,43125,preaching of love
43126,43126,but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments
43127,43127,with which these histories are filledadmitting that nations are
43128,43128,governed by some undefined force called an ideahistorys essential
43129,43129,and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the
43130,43130,connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is
43131,43131,possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred
43132,43132,with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with
43133,43133,another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal
43134,43134,nexus of this new force with the event
43135,43135,undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live
43136,43136,between the intellectual activity of men and their historical
43137,43137,else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the
43138,43138,historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole
43139,43139,historical movement is hard to understand only the following
43140,43140,considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion 
43141,43141,agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
43142,43142,can therefore be readily introduced into any theory
43143,43143,but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this
43144,43144,kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something
43145,43145,describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of  for
43146,43146,of powerand say plainly that that was the result of napoleons will
43147,43147,explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not

43152,43152,its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement
43153,43153,lies in the smoke which the wind carries away
43154,43154,the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation
43155,43155,to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no
43156,43156,but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause
43157,43157,and explain further why the wheels go round and till he has reached
43158,43158,the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure
43159,43159,the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by
43160,43160,the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not
43161,43161,supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to
43162,43162,him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation
43163,43163,the only conception that can explain the movement of the
43164,43164,locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed
43165,43165,the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples
43166,43166,is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the
43167,43167,peoples
43168,43168,yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
43169,43169,peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force
43170,43170,is blown away
43171,43171,impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
43172,43172,of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain
43173,43173,end and the only such conception known to historians is that of
43174,43174,power
43175,43175,this conception is the one handle by means of which the material
43176,43176,one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception
43177,43177,of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated

43186,43186,concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too
43187,43187,many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone

43195,43195,while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite

43200,43200,having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
43201,43201,subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the
43202,43202,contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two
43203,43203,things either a return to the former belief in the direct
43204,43204,intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation
43205,43205,of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed
43206,43206,power
43207,43207,destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power
43208,43208,napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so
43209,43209,accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the
43210,43210,question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon
43211,43211,so what he ordered was done
43212,43212,this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was
43213,43213,essential to determine what is this power of one man over others
43214,43214,it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak
43215,43215,onea domination based on the application or threat of physical
43216,43216,with a special strength of soul and mind called genius this power
43217,43217,mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions
43218,43218,than any of the millions they ruled over
43219,43219,if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
43220,43220,elsewherein the relation to the people of the man who wields the
43221,43221,power
43222,43222,that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys
43223,43223,understanding of power for true gold
43224,43224,a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to
43225,43225,definition of power needs explanation
43226,43226,the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the
43227,43227,modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon
43228,43228,from this fundamental difference between the view held by history
43229,43229,minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
43230,43230,about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
43231,43231,nothing
43232,43232,if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
43233,43233,criminals whom he arrested
43234,43234,do palace revolutionsin which sometimes only two or three people
43235,43235,take parttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler in
43236,43236,their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine
43237,43237,transferred to napoleon in  was the will of the russian people
43238,43238,french went to fight the austrians
43239,43239,to these questions three answers are possible
43240,43240,either to assume  that the will of the people is always
43241,43241,an infringement of the real power or  that the will of the
43242,43242,even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers
43243,43243,of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or
43244,43244, that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers
43245,43245,the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people
43246,43246,is transferred from some people to others
43247,43247,and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain
43248,43248,the relation of the people to their rulers
43249,43249,some historiansthose biographical and specialist historians
43250,43250,already referred toin their simplicity failing to understand the
43251,43251,will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical
43252,43252,that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of
43253,43253,powermere violence
43254,43254,periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise
43255,43255,simultaneously and struggle with one anotherthat a legitimist
43256,43256,republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention
43257,43257,others were violations of power evidently the explanations
43258,43258,furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only
43259,43259,satisfy young children
43260,43260,historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the
43261,43261,power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will
43262,43262,of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this
43263,43263,continually contradict one another
43264,43264,but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature
43265,43265,of this programor even admitting that some one general program of
43266,43266,these conditions existsthe facts of history almost always contradict
43267,43267,that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted
43268,43268,is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns
43269,43269,react on louis xiv or on louis xvwhy should it react just on louis
43270,43270,xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions
43271,43271,there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain
43272,43272,why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from
43273,43273,napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the peoples
43274,43274,are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal
43275,43275,delegations of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on
43276,43276,these historians not as the results of free transferences of the
43277,43277,these historians also see and admit historical events which are
43278,43278,exceptions to the theory
43279,43279,historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
43280,43280,conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have
43281,43281,power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has
43282,43282,been delegated to them
43283,43283,those leaders
43284,43284,people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the
43285,43285,people
43286,43286,but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
43287,43287,leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some part
43288,43288,of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression
43289,43289,of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or
43290,43290,evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the
43291,43291,activity of an historical leader which serves to express the
43292,43292,the nations life consists
43293,43293,met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
43294,43294,humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by
43295,43295,the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or
43296,43296,hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the
43297,43297,and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption
43298,43298,that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the
43299,43299,never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people
43300,43300,creatures
43301,43301,history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples
43302,43302,of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive
43303,43303,is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and
43304,43304,siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the
43305,43305,terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski
43306,43306,is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained
43307,43307,by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louises and their
43308,43308,remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the
43309,43309,cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the
43310,43310,crusadethe deliverance of jerusalemhad been clearly defined by
43311,43311,which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the
43312,43312,history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover
43313,43313,the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the
43314,43314,but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has
43315,43315,remained unknown
43316,43316,still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us
43317,43317,the life of the peoples
43318,43318,the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
43319,43319,life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a
43320,43320,hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was
43321,43321,suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why
43322,43322,during the french revolution they guillotined one another
43323,43323,the history of the life of the peoples
43324,43324,chapter v
43325,43325,the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few
43326,43326,found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of
43327,43327,the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
43328,43328,hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history
43329,43329,the theory of the transference of the collective will of the
43330,43330,people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of
43331,43331,nothing
43332,43332,the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of
43333,43333,theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead
43334,43334,because the collective will was transferred to him
43335,43335,the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
43336,43336,paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in
43337,43337,should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens
43338,43338,to be at its head
43339,43339,"the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in
that leader this is what historians of the first class saythose"
43340,43340,who assume the unconditional transference of the peoples will
43341,43341,"if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the
collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them
in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply"
43342,43342,historians who assume that the collective will of the people is
43343,43343,delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known with
43344,43344,"if the animals in front are continually changing and the
direction of the whole herd is constantly altered this is because
in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will
to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the
movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent
animals moving on all sides of the herd so say the third class of"
43345,43345,the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
43346,43346,persons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in other
43347,43347,words
43348,43348,what causes historical events power what is power power is the
43349,43349,collective will of the people transferred to one person under what
43350,43350,condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on
43351,43351,condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people
43352,43352,of which we do not understand
43353,43353,"then having subjected to criticism the explanation of ""power"" that"
43354,43354,merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena
43355,43355,his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a
43356,43356,word but an actually existing phenomenon
43357,43357,not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective
43358,43358,existence of power is proved both by history and by observing
43359,43359,contemporary events
43360,43360,will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree
43361,43361,and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue
43362,43362,decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and
43363,43363,an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french
43364,43364,submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs
43365,43365,it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have
43366,43366,decreed it
43367,43367,supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience
43368,43368,on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans
43369,43369,willhis wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an
43370,43370,cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of
43371,43371,will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any
43372,43372,sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs
43373,43373,without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity
43374,43374,"we cannot regard ""power"" as the cause of events"
43375,43375,that exists between the expression of someones will and the execution
43376,43376,of that will by others
43377,43377,to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first
43378,43378,man and not to the deity
43379,43379,an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will
43380,43380,connection of commands with events we must restore  the
43381,43381,condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in
43382,43382,inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and
43383,43383,those who execute his command
43384,43384,chapter vi
43385,43385,can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of
43386,43386,by his sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but
43387,43387,man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs
43388,43388,no command can be executed without some preceding order having been
43389,43389,given rendering the execution of the last command possible
43390,43390,never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only
43391,43391,of an event
43392,43392,consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have
43393,43393,commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered
43394,43394,which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events
43395,43395,which brought the french armies into russia
43396,43396,if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an
43397,43397,invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much
43398,43398,which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a
43399,43399,conviction he repeatedly expressedthis came about because his
43400,43400,but did so correspond in the latter
43401,43401,should order what can be executed but to know what can and what
43402,43402,to prevent its execution every order executed is always one of an
43403,43403,immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with
43404,43404,the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get
43405,43405,linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a
43406,43406,our false conception that an event is caused by a command which
43407,43407,precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and
43408,43408,out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent
43409,43409,chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in
43410,43410,this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized
43411,43411,into a single expression of will
43412,43412,we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in
43413,43413,reality in all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling
43414,43414,coincided with the course of events that led the french army into
43415,43415,russia just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not
43416,43416,because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the
43417,43417,stencil
43418,43418,so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the
43419,43419,but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two
43420,43420,to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
43421,43421,reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not
43422,43422,command himself takes part in
43423,43423,this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what
43424,43424,is called power this relation consists in the following
43425,43425,which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common
43426,43426,same
43427,43427,men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations
43428,43428,for which they have combined
43429,43429,of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one
43430,43430,of the most striking and definite examples is an army
43431,43431,every army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank
43432,43432,and fileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next
43433,43433,higher military rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom
43434,43434,concentrated in one person
43435,43435,of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and
43436,43436,file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of
43437,43437,of which will represent the commander in chief
43438,43438,these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the
43439,43439,noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the
43440,43440,commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the
43441,43441,himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the
43442,43442,of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another
43443,43443,is seen in every combination of men for common activityin
43444,43444,and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of
43445,43445,any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to
43446,43446,combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in
43447,43447,performing the action the less they can command and the more
43448,43448,who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his
43449,43449,activity chiefly to commanding
43450,43450,this relation of the men who command to those they command is what
43451,43451,constitutes the essence of the conception called power
43452,43452,having restored the condition of time under which all events
43453,43453,corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of
43454,43454,by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest
43455,43455,part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively
43456,43456,directed to commanding
43457,43457,chapter vii
43458,43458,when an event is taking place people express their opinions and
43459,43459,to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions
43460,43460,as a command preceding it
43461,43461,men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to
43462,43462,that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have
43463,43463,command and power in their primary form the man who worked most
43464,43464,reflect on or command what would result from the common activity
43465,43465,while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his
43466,43466,hands on account of his greater verbal activity
43467,43467,when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a
43468,43468,in the direct work
43469,43469,when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections
43470,43470,for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and
43471,43471,kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification
43472,43472,appears in peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare
43473,43473,justifications of the events have no common sense and are all
43474,43474,the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very
43475,43475,necessary significance in their own day
43476,43476,these justifications release those who produce the events from moral
43477,43477,responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
43478,43478,of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they
43479,43479,clear mens moral responsibilities from their path
43480,43480,without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
43481,43481,question that presents itself when examining each historical event
43482,43482,with the present complex forms of political and social life in
43483,43483,there any collective action which cannot find its justification in
43484,43484,civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides
43485,43485,itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men
43486,43486,will always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship
43487,43487,the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion
43488,43488,only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that
43489,43489,flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince
43490,43490,ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement
43491,43491,ourselves were imperceptibly moving
43492,43492,we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of
43493,43493,condition of all that occursthe continuity of movement in time
43494,43494,and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical
43495,43495,persons with the masses
43496,43496,when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same
43497,43497,turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the
43498,43498,wave anticipating its movement
43499,43499,whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
43500,43500,distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the
43501,43501,ships movement also
43502,43502,examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
43503,43503,that the events depended on those commands but examining the events
43504,43504,themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
43505,43505,what it maythen out of all the continually expressed wishes of
43506,43506,different people some will always be found which by their meaning
43507,43507,and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events
43508,43508,arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively
43509,43509,to these two essential questions of history
43510,43510, what is power
43511,43511, what force produces the movement of the nations
43512,43512,his participation in that action
43513,43513,those taking the largest direct share in the event take on
43514,43514,themselves the least responsibility and vice versa
43515,43515,morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event
43516,43516,physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral
43517,43517,is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two
43518,43518,the phenomena we are examining
43519,43519,in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final
43520,43520,limit to which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it
43521,43521,produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one
43522,43522,another
43523,43523,the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we
43524,43524,other words that it is a law
43525,43525,chapter viii
43526,43526,of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have
43527,43527,finished our argument but the law of history relates to man a
43528,43528,particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of
43529,43529,subject to the law
43530,43530,all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered
43531,43531,this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and
43532,43532,the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the
43533,43533,lack of a solution of that question
43534,43534,incidents
43535,43535,mans in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy
43536,43536,the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of
43537,43537,humanity
43538,43538,ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most
43539,43539,ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance
43540,43540,the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from
43541,43541,philosophicwe find a general law of necessity to which he like
43542,43542,all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves
43543,43543,this consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from
43544,43544,but only through consciousness does he know himself
43545,43545,apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of
43546,43546,reason is conceivable
43547,43547,all be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of
43548,43548,conscious of his volition but his willwhich forms the essence of
43549,43549,his lifeman recognizes and can but recognize as free
43550,43550,by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking
43551,43551,nevervarying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation
43552,43552,of it were it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to
43553,43553,him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as
43554,43554,free
43555,43555,you say i am not and am not free but i have lifted my hand and let
43556,43556,it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an
43557,43557,irrefutable demonstration of freedom
43558,43558,that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not
43559,43559,subject to reason
43560,43560,if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and
43561,43561,independent source of selfconsciousness it would be subject to
43562,43562,exist and is inconceivable
43563,43563,submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or
43564,43564,impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the same
43565,43565,series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete
43566,43566,motives acting upon him yet man never submits to the deductions of
43567,43567,these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and
43568,43568,and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled
43569,43569,he does not and cannot believe this
43570,43570,however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
43571,43571,same conditions and with the same character he will do the same
43572,43572,same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that
43573,43573,that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in
43574,43574,conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot
43575,43575,for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable
43576,43576,moment
43577,43577,freedom
43578,43578,a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
43579,43579,life
43580,43580,if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
43581,43581,contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one
43582,43582,only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason
43583,43583,no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the
43584,43584,question
43585,43585,consciousness of mans freedom that is a question for theology
43586,43586,the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed
43587,43587,of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question
43588,43588,for jurisprudence
43589,43589,mans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives
43590,43590,acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and
43591,43591,wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom
43592,43592,that is a question for ethics
43593,43593,man in connection with the general life of humanity appears
43594,43594,subject to laws which determine that life but the same man apart from
43595,43595,that connection appears to free how should the past life of nations
43596,43596,history
43597,43597,only in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledge
43598,43598,printed matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on
43599,43599,a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the
43600,43600,ignoramuseshave taken the work of the naturalists who deal with
43601,43601,one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem
43602,43602,for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
43603,43603,movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul
43604,43604,and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we
43605,43605,thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such
43606,43606,ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative
43607,43607,zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the
43608,43608,of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an
43609,43609,instrument for the illumination of one side of it for the fact
43610,43610,may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of
43611,43611,of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theoriesthat
43612,43612,from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of
43613,43613,necessity but it does not advance by a hairs breadth the solution of
43614,43614,consciousness of freedom
43615,43615,as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at
43616,43616,a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is
43617,43617,how mans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
43618,43618,necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
43619,43619,consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity
43620,43620,is now so smooth and regular
43621,43621,chapter ix
43622,43622,history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which
43623,43623,refer to the essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the
43624,43624,past and under certain conditions
43625,43625,as experimental science stands to abstract science
43626,43626,the subject for history is not mans will itself but our
43627,43627,presentation of it
43628,43628,incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it
43629,43629,presentation of mans life in which the union of these two
43630,43630,contradictions has already taken place
43631,43631,clearly and definitely understood without any sense of
43632,43632,and partly compulsory
43633,43633,to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined
43634,43634,philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that
43635,43635,taken by other sciences instead of first defining the conceptions
43636,43636,definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves
43637,43637,from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and
43638,43638,that always appear dependent on these two elements
43639,43639,whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an
43640,43640,of mans free will and partly of the law of inevitability
43641,43641,whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the
43642,43642,someones action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of
43643,43643,degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these
43644,43644,people is clearly defined for us
43645,43645,our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
43646,43646,every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom
43647,43647,and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure
43648,43648,of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more
43649,43649,and the more inevitability the less freedom
43650,43650,the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
43651,43651,but their relation is always one of inverse proportion
43652,43652,a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry
43653,43653,trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a
43654,43654,a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly
43655,43655,in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of
43656,43656,years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was
43657,43657,or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who
43658,43658,seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in
43659,43659,all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished
43660,43660,and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or
43661,43661,regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the
43662,43662,smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa
43663,43663,and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity
43664,43664,and freedom
43665,43665,all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
43666,43666,necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations
43667,43667, the relation to the external world of the man who commits the
43668,43668,deeds
43669,43669, his relation to time
43670,43670, his relation to the causes leading to the action
43671,43671,the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the
43672,43672,mans relation to the external world and the greater or lesser
43673,43673,clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by
43674,43674,the man in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what
43675,43675,makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject
43676,43676,actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly
43677,43677,those of a man living in solitude and seclusion
43678,43678,the light that falls on the things about himwe see that each of
43679,43679,these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some
43680,43680,side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the
43681,43681,more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our
43682,43682,conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases
43683,43683,the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation
43684,43684,of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the
43685,43685,place the mans action occupies in time that is the ground which
43686,43686,marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people
43687,43687,who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot
43688,43688,of which are still unknown to me
43689,43689,the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends
43690,43690,in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the
43691,43691,performance of the action and our judgment of it
43692,43692,if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the
43693,43693,that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it
43694,43694,then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i
43695,43695,find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not
43696,43696,becomes my belief in the freedom of my action
43697,43697,in history we find a very similar progress of conviction
43698,43698,concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of
43699,43699,humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing
43700,43700,see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else
43701,43701,possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less
43702,43702,arbitrary do they appear
43703,43703,the austroprussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of
43704,43704,heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying
43705,43705,its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine
43706,43706,crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain
43707,43707,people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter
43708,43708,anyones head today to suppose that the renovation of the european
43709,43709,world depended on attilas caprice the farther back in history the
43710,43710,of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law
43711,43711,of inevitability
43712,43712,the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
43713,43713,have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a
43714,43714,cause of what will follow
43715,43715,the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the
43716,43716,inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others
43717,43717,appear
43718,43718,ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we
43719,43719,most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the case of
43720,43720,a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case
43721,43721,independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act
43722,43722,is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are
43723,43723,original action that a criminal was reared among male factors
43724,43724,mitigates his fault in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a father or
43725,43725,less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the
43726,43726,we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity if we
43727,43727,directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in peoples
43728,43728,free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if
43729,43729,we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under
43730,43730,free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we
43731,43731,see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as
43732,43732,soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the
43733,43733,result
43734,43734,on these three considerations alone is based the conception of
43735,43735,irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
43736,43736,by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less
43737,43737,according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
43738,43738,to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of
43739,43739,lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action
43740,43740,chapter x
43741,43741,thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually
43742,43742,diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser
43743,43743,relation to which we contemplate a mans life
43744,43744,so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
43745,43745,and a minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on
43746,43746,a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom
43747,43747,plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and
43748,43748,incomprehensible the causes of the action may becan we ever conceive
43749,43749,either complete freedom or complete necessity
43750,43750, to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
43751,43751,freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what
43752,43752,surrounds him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my
43753,43753,action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my
43754,43754,which there was least obstruction to that action either from things
43755,43755,around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out
43756,43756,of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest
43757,43757,obstacles for my action to be free it was necessary that it should
43758,43758,encounter no obstacles to conceive of a man being free we must
43759,43759, however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time
43760,43760,examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it
43761,43761,could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has
43762,43762,already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next
43763,43763,moment but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first
43764,43764,moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not
43765,43765,that now surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was made
43766,43766,whatever movement i made would be the only one that i did not lift my
43767,43767,arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from
43768,43768,lifting it then and since i could make only one movement at that
43769,43769,impossible
43770,43770, however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
43771,43771,an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of
43772,43772,for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to
43773,43773,an action without a cause is the cause of my action
43774,43774,causewe were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of
43775,43775,is no longer a man
43776,43776,in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite
43777,43777,devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability
43778,43778, however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space
43779,43779,the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of
43780,43780,space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men
43781,43781,measure of freedom remains
43782,43782, however we may prolong the period of time between the action
43783,43783,be absolute inevitability
43784,43784, however accessible may be the chain of causation of any
43785,43785,so again we never reach absolute inevitability
43786,43786,is no freedom there is also no man and so the conception of the
43787,43787,action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any
43788,43788,element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a
43789,43789,mans completely free action
43790,43790,and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
43791,43791,to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
43792,43792,should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
43793,43793,we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which mans
43794,43794,whole outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensible
43795,43795,reason says  space with all the forms of matter that give it
43796,43796,is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable
43797,43797,otherwise  the connection between cause and effect has no
43798,43798,beginning and can have no end
43799,43799,consequently i include space  i measure flowing time by the
43800,43800,fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as
43801,43801,feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life
43802,43802,reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability
43803,43803,consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom
43804,43804,consciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in its
43805,43805,three forms
43806,43806,freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines
43807,43807,freedom is the content inevitability is the form
43808,43808,separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability
43809,43809,only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans life
43810,43810,apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define
43811,43811,all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation
43812,43812,of reason
43813,43813,all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
43814,43814,of life to the laws of reason
43815,43815,the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious
43816,43816,in man and we call that freedom
43817,43817,we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the
43818,43818,the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that
43819,43819,historic laws
43820,43820,all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
43821,43821,laws of reason
43822,43822,mans free will differs from every other force in that man is
43823,43823,another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the
43824,43824,force of mans free will is distinguished by reason from the other
43825,43825,sensation of life
43826,43826,and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly
43827,43827,same way does the force of free will form the content of history
43828,43828,but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of
43829,43829,this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
43830,43830,metaphysics
43831,43831,in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
43832,43832,force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above
43833,43833,what we know of the essence of life
43834,43834,so also in history what is known to us we call laws of
43835,43835,history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know
43836,43836,about the laws of human life
43837,43837,chapter xi
43838,43838,history examines the manifestations of mans free will in connection
43839,43839,science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws
43840,43840,the recognition of mans free will as something capable of
43841,43841,same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the
43842,43842,heavenly bodies would be for astronomy
43843,43843,that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of
43844,43844,conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists
43845,43845,of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
43846,43846,dependence on cause
43847,43847,more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define
43848,43848,those laws is the problem of history
43849,43849,from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards
43850,43850,becomes impossible
43851,43851,laws as its problem
43852,43852,the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
43853,43853,thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
43854,43854,with the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissecting
43855,43855,the causes of phenomenathe old method of history is moving
43856,43856,all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at
43857,43857,the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the
43858,43858,in another form but along the same path of reflection the other
43859,43859,sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity
43860,43860,he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction
43861,43861,he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the
43862,43862,the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the
43863,43863,infinitely small the same is done by the natural sciences leaving
43864,43864,same path and if history has for its object the study of the movement
43865,43865,of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in
43866,43866,interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will
43867,43867,chapter xii
43868,43868,mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth
43869,43869,that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the
43870,43870,ancients by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain
43871,43871,ptolemaic worlds but even after the discovery of the law of
43872,43872,copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time
43873,43873,from the time the first person said and proved that the number of
43874,43874,or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and
43875,43875,had been built were destroyed in their essence
43876,43876,by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have
43877,43877,been retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to
43878,43878,continue studying historic events as the results of mans free will
43879,43879,for if a certain mode of government was established or certain
43880,43880,migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such
43881,43881,of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of
43882,43882,government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as
43883,43883,the cause
43884,43884,and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with
43885,43885,the struggle between the old views and the new was long and
43886,43886,stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on
43887,43887,guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation
43888,43888,on the new foundation
43889,43889,just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding
43890,43890,subverting revelation
43891,43891,passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret
43892,43892,other is the passion for destruction
43893,43893,to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical
43894,43894,miracle of joshua the son of nun to the defenders of the laws of
43895,43895,gravitation as a weapon against religion
43896,43896,just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
43897,43897,built up on those conceptions
43898,43898,on which the institutions of state and church are erected
43899,43899,measure of visible phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability
43900,43900,will
43901,43901,as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the
43902,43902,earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths
43903,43903,difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of
43904,43904,independence of ones own personality but as in astronomy the new
43905,43905,"view said ""it is true that we do not feel the movement of the"
43906,43906,in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness
43907,43907,of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did
43908,43908,not feel in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce
43909,43909,which we are not conscious
